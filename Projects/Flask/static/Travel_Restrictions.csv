*Travel in Afghanistan: Healthcare in Afghanistan is very limited. Medical facilities, including those in Kabul, do not have the capacity or capability to effectively deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The supply of ICU beds and ventilators is low. There are areas which have no medical facilities with ICU beds and ventilators.<br>
There is no guarantee that any local health care will be available in the current security situation. Whilst an estimated 30 per cent of the population had been exposed to COVID-19 by June 2020, WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask-wearing protocols.

Check the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/""> Australian Governments COVID-19 website</a> for the latest information including changes to quarantine-free travel. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: From 1 November 2021, modified quarantine arrangements including no quarantine on arrival may be available for fully vaccinated travellers arriving in Australia. <br>
Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should check requirements for the <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">state or territory</a> in which you will arrive. <br>
Travellers will need to comply with the quarantine requirements at their port of arrival, before travelling to another state or territory.

*Testing/Screening on arrival: Travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. <br>
The Australian authorities provide an <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers"">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements. <br>
For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites.
*Transiting Australia: The <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus. <br>
You’re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you’re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. <br>
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. <br>
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">State and Territory websites</a> for the latest details and how to apply. <br>
All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. <br>
If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">State and Territory websites  </a> for details on quarantine. <br>
British nationals are able to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. If your transit time is longer than 8 hours you will need a valid visa. See the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> for details including how to apply. <br>
If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel. <br>
*If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new one to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. The type of visa you can apply for to remain in Australia usually depends on the type of visa you currently hold. For example, those on Visitor visas would be expected to apply for new Visitor visas. <br>
You can find more detail for temporary visa holders, including visitors, students and working holiday makers on the Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions"">webpage</a> .
*Leaving Australia: You should check the <ahref=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia""> Department of Home Affairs website</a> for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption. <br>
From 1 November, fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents will not require an exemption.<br>
Dual Australian/ foreign nationals and permanent residents who are unvaccinated (apart from those under 12 and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) are required to apply for an exemption to leave Australia. Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to leave the country, but will need an exemption if they want to re-enter. <br>
Temporary visa holders seeking to leave Australia for a short trip and then return will need to apply for an inwards exemption before they leave – see the Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia#toc-6"">‘Leaving Australia’ web pages  </a> for more information.

Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place. <br>
*Arrive with a COVID 19 negative test: All travellers from the UK must present on arrival a valid COVID-19 PCR negative test result taken no more than 3 days in advance of your flight’s arrival. Please note that the test can be taken at any time during the day 3 days prior to the date of your arrival in Barbados. (For example, if your flight arrives at 10pm on Saturday, you can take a test at any time on the Wednesday prior to this.) You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent. <br>
All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via <a href=https://www.travelform.gov.bb/home"""">Travel Form</a>.

You may be obliged on arrival to complete an assessment at one of the government isolation facilities for up to 48 hours before being released from quarantine. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Barbados will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>

Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found in the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>. If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated then you will be treated as if you are unvaccinated. A number of fully vaccinated arrivals will be randomly chosen to have a rapid antigen test. There is no requirement to quarantine, as the result will be made available very quickly. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for further details. <br>

This will be at your own expense. You will need to remain at your designated accommodation until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied that you have recovered. This may mean a mandatory stay of several weeks in Barbados. Upon recovery, tourists can continue their holiday or return home.

Internations Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry to Cameroon: There are now some commercial flight options to leave Cameroon. Cameroon has closed all its land, sea and air borders in response to coronavirus and has only partly reopened to nationals, residents, diplomats and professionals. Proof of a recent (no older than three days before application) negative coronavirus test must be provided to obtain a visa. Separately, you must have proof of a recent (no older than three days before first boarding) negative coronavirus test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test (e.g. PCR).<br>
 *Testing/screening on arrival: On 29 October, the Cameroonian authorities decreed that passengers coming from some countries particularly affected by COVID-19 (described as in ‘the red zone’, but with no further clarification) will be subjected to extra testing for COVID-19 on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon. <br>
 *Quarantine requirements: If you have a proof of a recent (no older than three days before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport must quarantine at a government-monitored hotel for 14 days. These requirements are regularly evolving.
  <br>
  <br> 
  Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *Travel in Cameroon: Travel within the country should be limited to essential travel only. The authorities have banned public transport (taxis, buses, motorbikes) from taking more passengers than they have seats. <br>
You must wear a mask or face covering to be allowed to enter any airport in Cameroon.  <br>
*Accommodation: Accommodation is generally open at the current time. <br>
*Public places and services: Gatherings of over 50 people are prohibited. Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted. <br>
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited.
You must wear a face mask in public spaces and there is occasional sanctioning of those people found to have breached restrictions and any confinement measures imposed on them. <br>
Schools and other educational establishments have reopened after closure during the summer of 2020. However, in the North West and South West regions, many remain closed due to the ongoing conflict. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

  Internal Restrictions:<br> 
*Travel in Canada: To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include: <br>
•        a ban on large social gatherings, where physical distancing is not possible<br>
•        closure of some public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres in affected cities and regions<br>
•        curfew or closure of bars and restaurants in affected cities and regions<br>
•        some public transport offering only a limited service<br>
•        mandatory wearing of face masks in indoor public settings <br>
*Public spaces and services: Anyone showing symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. <br>
The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. <br>
Federal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus. <br>

From India: Passengers from India can now travel to Canada albeit with a few precautionary measures, which include having a negative Covid-19 test report from an approved laboratory. Passengers must have proof of a negative Covid-19 molecular test from the approved Genestrings Laboratory at the Delhi airport, taken within 18 hours of the scheduled departure of their flight to Canada. Prior to boarding, air operators will be checking the travellers’ test results ensuring they are eligible to come to Canada. Fully vaccinated passengers will also have to upload the relevant information into the ArriveCAN mobile app or website. Officials will be ensuring that the passengers have done so and those who are unable to meet these requirements will be denied boarding.

*Travel in Chile: Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should review the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso#situacioncomunal/"">Chilean Government Paso a Paso website</a> to check which stage your ‘comuna’ is in. <br>
If you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. <br>
*Mobility Pass and Health Passport: Until 31 October, interregional travellers will need to have a <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">“Health Passport” </a>prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. <br>
From 1 November, the health passport will not be required, only the Mobility Pass will be requested for interregional travel. From 1 November, a Mobility Pass will be requested for children from age 12 and up. More details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass, including the documents required to validate the vaccination, is available <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">here</a> (in Spanish). <br>
The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreigners resident in Chile and non-resident foreigners who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’). You may obtain a Mobility Pass if you fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s 
<a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/""></a> MeVacuno website. This will generate a QR-code after entering your personal information. This permit can only be requested 14-days after completing a full COVID-19 vaccination course in Chile (i.e. after the second dose for a two-dose course COVID-19 vaccine such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, etc). <br>
From 1 November, interregional travellers without a Mobility Pass will be required to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. This test must be carried out in Chile. You should be aware that you are not allowed interregional travel if you are in quarantine after arriving in Chile. <br>
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you might be required to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. You should get in contact with your transport operator. <br>
*Paso a Paso Strategy: The Chilean government’s strategy to manage COVID-19 is called ‘Paso A Paso’. It has five stages: <br>
•        Stage 1 – Restriction <br>
•        Stage 2 – Transition <br>
•        Stage 3 – Preparation <br>
•        Stage 4 - Initial Reopening <br>
•        Stage 5 - Advanced Reopening <br>
Individual comunas will move forwards or backwards between these stages, depending on the level of COVID-19 infections in the region. Changes to the stage of a ‘comuna’ can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after. All rules for each Stage (Paso) will apply seven-days a week. <br>
In those areas under Stage 1 ‘Restriction’ you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food or medical supplies, you must get a permit from the <a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">Comisaria Virtual</a>. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. <br>
For further detailed information on rules for every Stage, you should review the Chilean Government <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso/"">Paso a Paso website</a>. <br>
*Public places and services: Chilean authorities require the use of facemasks in all public spaces, that you keep to social distancing rules; self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID case irrespective of the ‘Paso a Paso’ stage. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

 International Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry and transit: The Chinese authorities have suspended all direct flights from the UK. This measure will be subject to review but no date has been announced. Restrictions on travel to China from other countries, and the necessary requirements, may be different. Foreign including British nationals travelling to China from a third country should follow the directions on the website of the local Chinese Embassies or consulate for requirements from that country.
On 4 November the Chinese Embassy in some country announced the temporary suspension of entry into China by non-Chinese. Foreign nationals visiting China for emergencies can still apply for visas at Chinese Embassies or Consulates and entry by non-Chinese nationals in other country with visas issued after 3 November 2020 will not be affected. <br>
If you’re issued a visa to travel to China you will need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of negative nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br>
Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. You should arrange to take a private test.
On 15 March the Chinese authorities announced a relaxation of certain requirements for visa applicants who can prove inoculation with a vaccine produced in China. Travellers who have not had a vaccine are still able to enter China under the existing, limited circumstances described above. A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status: China has not yet confirmed that it will accept the solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination. <br>
*Health checks on arrival: All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment.  Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact your local Chinese Embassy before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities.
*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. <br>
You will be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus.  Non-residents may be charged for their care. <br>
Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. <br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room <br>
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>
•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>
•        Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations. <br>
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice, including requirements for evidence of a negative COVID-19 NAT test within 48 hours of travel from high to medium risk areas. <br>
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients. <br>

The designated place of isolation for foreign residents will be specified by the relevant Ministry, e.g. MINCEX in the case of foreign business officials, MINREX for foreign media, and Ministry of Higher Education (MES) for foreign students. <br>
If your first PCR test is positive, even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba, you will have to go into a ‘hotel hospital’ run by the Ministry of Public Health. <br>
The costs of the stay in the ‘hotel hospital’ (and any medication) must either be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company. As a contingency, it is worth bringing cash (GBP, US Dollars or Euros) to settle the bill (a rough guide is £160 per day). <br>
From 15 November you will no longer be given a PCR test on arrival.

Travellers who have had their full COVID-19 vaccination (i.e. both doses for those vaccinations which consist of two doses), received at least 14 days prior the flight date, can present their vaccination card, or its equivalent, instead of the above negative RT-PCR. However, the use of “Immunity Certificates or Vaccination Certificates/Cards” from foreign passengers will be subject to constant review. <br>

Only airline crew members, children under 2 years old and passengers on transit to other countries are exempt from the RT-PCR test or the COVID-19 vaccination certificate requirement. <br>
If, on arrival, a passenger presents COVID-19 related symptoms, they will be evaluated by an MSP health care worker, prior to their entry to the immigration area, and, if necessary, an Antigen rapid test will be arranged. If the result us positive, COVID-19 protocols will be activated and the passenger will be instructed to self isolate. <br>

 International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Ethiopia: There are special measures in place at all borders when entering Ethiopia. Proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the previous 120 hours (5 days), starting from the time the sample is given, is required for all air passengers over the age of 10 years entering Ethiopia. Arrivals must then complete 7 days mandatory self-quarantine. <br>
Ethiopia has announced its intention to use the Africa Union Trusted Travel process for validating Covid-19 tests for passengers. All passengers arriving in, departing from or transiting Ethiopia should validate their COVID-19 RT PCR test via the <a href=""https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/trusted-testing/signup/"">Africa Union Trusted Travel</a> or <a href=""https://globalhaven.org/travel-guide/"">UNDP Global Haven</a> systems (you will need to register an account on one of these sites). These systems will generate a digital Trusted Travel reference code for your test, which should be presented upon request. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Transiting Ethiopia:  Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours. <br>
Passengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>
Passengers transiting Addis Ababa Bole International Airport are subject to COVID-19 screening measures during transit. See below. If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline. <br>
*Screening on arrival: Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international airports) have put in place measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include checking COVID-19 test results, temperature measurements, completing a health screening questionnaire and answering questions from health officials on recent travel and your accommodation details for your self-isolation (see Quarantine requirements below). <br>
Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and will be tested. Any person that tests positive for COVID-19 will be prohibited from entering Ethiopia. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. <br>
*COVID-19 Test and Quarantine requirements: Proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the previous 120 hours (5 days), starting from the time the sample is given, is required for all air passengers over the age of 10 years entering Ethiopia (except diplomats). Only RT PCR tests will be accepted. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight. <br>
You will need to complete 7 days mandatory self-isolation on arrival. You must provide the address for your self-isolation upon arrival. However, passengers who have a certificate of recovery from COVID -19 within the last 90 days or have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are not required to self-isolate. <br>
Diplomats are encouraged to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate as above. If they do not present a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test certificate, they will be expected to get an RT PCR or Antigen-Based COVID-19 test upon arrival. If the result is negative, they will not be required to self-isolate. If diplomats do not present a negative test certificate or refuse to get the test on arrival, they will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: Face masks are required in all enclosed public spaces. It is no longer a requirement to wear a mask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen. <br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
From 9 August, certain forms of transport, such as cross country trains, will require passengers to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. For further details on what this involves see the ‘public spaces and services’ section below. Since 20 June, there has been no curfew in place across the French territory and there are no internal travel restrictions. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/Attestations-de-deplacement-couvre-feu"">French Interior Ministry website</a> or use the ‘Tous anti-Covid’ digital app for further information. <br>
These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">local guidance</a> for further information.
Full information about restrictions in France can be found <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus."">here</a>
*Public spaces and services: People attending events and cultural spaces with over 50 people will need to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria: <br>
1) A vaccination certificate, which conforms to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means: <br>
•        7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna <br>
•        28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson <br>
•        7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in  France) <br>
2) A negative PCR or antigen test result from within the last 72 hours. <br>
3) A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID. <br>
From 9 August, you will need this to access a range of services and venues including leisure facilities (bars, restaurants, museums, cinemas), hospitals, retirement homes and modes of transport such as long distance train and bus journeys and planes. Those aged 12 to 17 will only be subject to this requirement from 30 September. <br>
You can find more information on how to access the “pass sanitaire” from the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">French government</a>.
You can also choose to scan and save your QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app. <br>
Those vaccinated in Wales can download a PDF certificate through the online web portal and that will contain a QR code which they can then present for verification. You can also choose to scan and save your NHS QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app. <br>
Those vaccinated in Northern Ireland can demonstrate their vaccination status by presenting a QR code from the COVIDCert NI digital wallet, downloaded pdf certificate, or printed certificate. You can also choose to scan and save your QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app. More information on how to obtain a certificate/QR code. <br>
Scottish vaccine certificates are not yet accepted for domestic use in France. <br>
Vaccinated non-EU tourists, including those from Scotland, can request a QR code for domestic use from the French government if travelling to France. To be eligible, you will need to provide the following evidence by email: <br>
•        A vaccination certificate <br>
•        A valid passport <br>
•        Return travel tickets <br>
A completed <a href=""https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/demande_de_conversion_de_certificat_de_vaccination_en_cle85188d.pdf"">application form</a>   
The documents can be provided in PDF, JPG or PNG form, and sent to area3.covid-pass@diplomatie.gouv.fr. The email subject line should read: COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE / SURNAME first name. <br>
You will receive a QR code by email once the application has been processed, which can then be presented on paper or electronically. <br>
This system is initially open to those already in France or arriving on or before 15 August. Subsequent arrivals will be processed at a later date. You can find full information at the <a href=""https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/coronavirus-advice-for-foreign-nationals-in-france/coronavirus-statements/article/applying-for-a-covid-certificate-if-you-were-vaccinated-abroad-procedure-for"">French government website</a>. Other Covid status certification that conforms with the EU Digital COVID Certification scheme (e.g. from other EU member states) can also be used for entry into settings where there is a COVID status certification requirement in France. <br>
It is compulsory to wear facemasks in enclosed public spaces. This applies to those aged 11 and over. From 17 June 2021, it is no longer required to wear a facemask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information. <br>

 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*COVID-19 restrictions: Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated must continue to adhere to basic non-pharmaceutical guidelines, such as social distancing, wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and regularly ventilating indoor spaces. Wearing a medical-grade mask remains a legal requirement in retail outlets and on public transport. <br>
From 23 August proof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test (up to 24hrs old for rapid antigen testing or 48 hrs old for PCR testing) will be required for entry into: <br>
•        Hospitals and social care settings<br>
•        Indoor gastronomy<br>
•        Participating in events and celebrations<br>
•        Barbers, hairdressers, or beauty salons<br>
•        Indoor sport such as fitness studios, swimming baths or sports halls<br>
•        Hotels (test at arrival and twice a week during the stay)<br>
Children five years old and above are exempt from domestic testing requirements. As school pupils are regularly tested at school, they only need to show their school pupil card to prove their C-19 status. Individual States are able to forgo the above rules under certain circumstances, including where the incidence rate is below 35.<br>
The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status by either using yellow vaccination booklets ‘Impfpass’ which contain a doctor’s signature and stamp or two C-19 certification apps (the CovPass-App or the Corona-Warn-App; see below). Other vaccination certification is accepted for domestic purposes in both electronic and analogue form as long as it has:<br>
•        The date of vaccination;<br>
•        Name and batch name of the vaccine;<br>
•        Name of the disease against which vaccination was given;<br>
•        Name of the person vaccinated, their date of birth and the name and address of the person responsible for administering the vaccination, and;<br>
•        Confirmation in writing or in electronic form with a qualified electronic signature or a qualified electronic seal by the person responsible for administering the vaccination.<br>
Those who have recently recovered from Covid must show a positive PCR test at least 28 days old but no older than six months.<br>
From 11 October 2021 rapid antigen tests will be no longer be available free of charge. For those who have not been recommended for vaccination, such as pregnant women or children under the age of 18, tests will remain free of charge.<br>
Additional rules apply in settings that can cause super-spreader events, such as mass gatherings, events in enclosed spaces, parties, bars and clubs. State and local authorities can restrict capacity at such venues. The 16 German States have agreed to restrict mass sporting events to 50% capacity above 5,000 participants and not exceed a total of 25,000 participants.<br>
As rules may vary please check the latest <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-bundeslaender-1745198"">local guidance</a>

*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany: Anyone testing positive with a Point of Care (PoC) antigen test is required to take a follow-up PCR test immediately and to self-isolate. Close contacts are also required to self-isolate, although exceptions may apply for those who are fully vaccinated. <br>
In the event of a positive PoC test, the test provider is required to notify the local health office (Gesundheitsamt), which is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode <a href=""https://tools.rki.de/plztool/"">here</a>. <br>
Individuals testing positive must self-isolate in their home or where they are staying locally, or in another appropriate location enabling self-isolation. They may only leave their home and interrupt self-isolation to carry out the PCR test. Germany does not operate a system of managed quarantine in government facilities. <br>
Mandatory self-isolation ceases in the event of a negative PCR test. Otherwise self-isolation lasts for 14 days, or until the local health office confirms release. <br>

All travellers entering Germany have to provide a negative test result or proof of full vaccination, or proof of recovery, independent from where they arrive. Children under 12 years old are exempted from testing requirements.<br>
From 1 August 2021, risk areas will be designated in two categories: high-risk areas and virus variant areas. The category of ""simple"" risk areas is omitted.

The entry rule is based on the country from which the traveller is coming from, and not on nationality. <br>
- From high-risk area: Travellers entering Germany, who have been in a risk area within the last 10 days before entry, are obliged to register at ww.einreiseanmeldung.de. and must self-isolate until they submit to the digital registration on entry either: <br>
• proof of vaccination against COVID-19: Accepted vaccines: all those listed on the website of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut. At least 14 days must have elapsed since the second dose of the vaccine dose (or single dose for Johnson&Johnson). Vaccinated and convalescents can end the quarantine from the moment the proof of vaccination or convalescence is transmitted via the entry portal. If the transmission takes place before entry (is strongly recommended), the quarantine does not have to be started;<br>
• proof of recovery from COVID-19, certified by a positive PCR test result carried out at least 28 days before, and not older than 6 months;<br>
• a pre-departure negative PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival (or a rapid antigen test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival). In this case, the 10-day quarantine period may be ended on the basis of a negative test carried out no earlier than 5 days after entry. For children under 12 years self-isolation ends automatically after 5 days.<br> 
- From virus variant area: An exception to the quarantine obligation for fully vaccinated persons after previous stay in a virus variant area does not exist. When entering from so-called virus variant areas, a transport ban applies to passenger transport by train, bus, ship and flight from these countries. In the case of a previous stay in a virus variant area, it is generally fourteen days. Premature termination in virus variant areas is particularly sought if the affected virus variant area is downgraded during the separation period in Germany, the regulations for this type of area apply to the termination of the separation.<br>

International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Ghana: Kotoka International Airport is open. Commercial flights are operating to and from Ghana. Check with your travel company for the latest information. Land and sea borders remain closed. COVID-19 protocols at the airport may be subject to change as the new screening process evolves. See the guidance from the <a href=""http://www.gcaa.com.gh/web/?page_id=1172""> Ghana Civil Aviation Authority</a>. <br>
Passengers travelling to Ghana are required to undergo a COVID test 72hrs before departure; complete additional health declaration forms on arrival; and undergo a further COVID test on arrival: <br>
*Coronavirus tests before departure: On 21 April the Government of Ghana introduced the mandatory digitisation of all COVID-19 tests for international air travel, with the implementation of the Trusted Travel Scheme. Passengers travelling to Ghana are now required to: <br>
Take a Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test with one of the listed providers within 72 hours of departure. <br> Visit <a href=""https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/"">https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ </a> for a certified list of providers. <br>
Create an account at <ahref=""https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/"">https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/</a> with the same email address and mobile telephone number you give your PCR test provider. Log on and select check-in; select your country and Ghana as your departure and destination countries; select lab tests (TT); select the matching lab test from the drop down options; click save; provide your flight and passport details as requested; click save to generate a Travel Code (TC); your TC code is then generated for you to copy or download. <br>
If your provider is unable to upload your test certificate on your behalf you should enter your code from your PCR certificate, or upload the certificate yourself <br>
We also recommend travelling with hard copy proof of this negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result <br>
Children under the age of 5 are exempt. For passengers who have transited other countries before arriving in Ghana, the first country of departure will be the reference point. <br>
The same arrangements apply to passengers aged 11+ departing from Ghana to the UK, and you may not be allowed to board flights without uploading a certified Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test. Visit https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ for a certified list of providers in Ghana. We also recommend travelling with hard copy proof of this negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result, to present on departure. <br>
If the UK is your final destination, check-in staff will also confirm your UK passenger locator form has been completed and that all passengers aged 5+ have evidence of day 2 and 8 tests booked in UK. <br>
*Additional forms and checks upon arrival: On arrival to Ghana, passengers are also required by the Government of Ghana to: <br>
•        Complete an <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">online health declaration form  </a> pre-departure. All passengers may also be asked to complete hard copy self-declaration forms on the flight, confirming they are fit to travel and providing details to facilitate contact tracing. <br>
•        Wear a face-mask throughout their flight and upon landing in Accra. <br>
•        Undergo a temperature check on arrival. <br>
On arrival all passengers will be subject to a mandatory COVID-19 test at Kotoka International airport. The test is an antigen fluorescent immunoassay test and it will be conducted before baggage is collected at a cost of $150 per passenger. Payment should be made <a href=""https://myfrontierhealthcare.com/"">online </a>prior to boarding. Children under the age of five are exempt. <br>
During busy periods when there may be a large number of passengers disembarking at the same time the testing area may become busy. Test results are normally ready within one hour, depending how busy the airport is. The pre departure area where test results are collected can also get busy. You can check your results <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/""> online</a> while you wait. Be prepared for additional time to move through and exit the airport. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: All arriving passengers should be prepared to comply with Ghana’s COVID-19 Health Protocols. If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival you will be taken to mandatory quarantine in a Government Health facility. Quarantine and / or medical costs can be expensive so it is important that all passengers arrive with adequate access to financial resources. In these circumstances a PCR test is normally carried out on day two or three. That test result will normally be ready within 48 hours. The quarantine process is managed by Ghana Health Service.<br>
The Government of Ghana also advise that all arrivals should have valid insurance. It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. <br>
*Transiting Ghana: Transit passengers, except where they will remain in the airport throughout or those who were diverted to Accra for an emergency, will also be subject to mandatory COVID-19 testing as outlined above.<br> 
  <br>

 International Restrictions:<br> 
Government will tighten COVID-19 travel restrictions (Inquirer News, 26.10.2021).<br>
*Entry to Hong Kong: Currently the UK is on the Hong Kong SAR government’s list of “high risk places”. This means that most travellers arriving from the UK must be fully vaccinated Hong Kong residents. From 29 October, proof of a single dose of the BioNTech vaccination will be accepted for 12-17 year-old Hong Kong residents travelling from the UK, or those unable to receive a second vaccination for health reasons. Accompanied minors who are Hong Kong residents or children of Hong Kong residents (who are below the age of 12) are also allowed to enter Hong Kong. All other persons from ‘high risk places’ will be denied entry to Hong Kong. <br>
Travellers arriving to Hong Kong will need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 72 hours prior to their departure. Effective from 26 June, the Hong Kong Government has specified that this must be a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid test. Other types of tests such as the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) will not be accepted and do not fulfil the relevant boarding requirement. <br>
Travellers from “high risk” places will then be subject to 21 days of compulsory quarantine at a designated quarantine hotel on arrival, followed by 7 days of self-monitoring. Travellers arriving at Hong Kong International Airport from these places need to provide confirmation of a hotel room reservation in a designated quarantine hotel in Hong Kong for 21 days, starting on the day of their arrival.

Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Rambler Hotel in Tsing Yi. Please note that children under the age of 16 cannot stay at the Rambler Hotel unaccompanied. Parents who stay with their child at the HCTR on the first night whilst awaiting test results, will have to continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days. If travelling unaccompanied, there is a risk that a child may have to stay alone overnight at the airport on arrival while awaiting test results. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/holding_centre_en.pdf"">Centre for Health Protection’s website.</a>
Children over the age of 16 travelling to Hong Kong on their own must be met by an adult for checking in to the HCTR whilst they await test results. Please contact the Port Health Authority for the latest guidance (+852 3904 9333). <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
The Italian government has approved a new decree on 7 October (attached in its original Italian), governing access to cultural and recreational venues. It sets out the following terms, which take effect from 11 October (with Green Passes being required for admission): <br>
•        Cinemas, theatres, and concert halls: In white zones, these venues, whether indoors or outdoors, may return to 100% capacity.<br>
•        Spectator sports: In white zones, the maximum capacity for outdoor sports stadiums is 75%, while for indoor venues, the maximum capacity is 60%.<br>
•        Dance halls, night clubs, and similar venues: In white zones, these venues may reopen, but for outdoor venues, the maximum capacity is 75%, while for enclosed venues, the maximum capacity is 50%. Enclosed/indoor venues are required to employ ventilation systems without air recirculation. Masks must continue to be worn indoors, except while dancing.   <br>
On 21 September 2021, the host government signed into effect a new legislative decree (attached in its original Italian), which extends the requirement for a Green Pass to workplaces both in the public and private sectors. <br>
It stipulates that from 15 October - 31 December 2021:<br>
•  Both public and private sector employees as well as any other personnel who perform work or voluntary activities within public facilities or wherever private work is carried out must be in possession of a Green Pass and be able to display it upon request. This requirement does not apply to individuals exempted from vaccination on the basis of relevant medical certification issued in accordance with the criteria defined by the Italian Ministry of Health.<br>
• Employers are responsible for ensuring that their respective employees are in compliance with this requirement and must establish the appropriate modalities for such verification (even through random sampling) by 15 October. Ideally these checks should be carried out by formally designated personnel at the point of access to the workplace.<br>
• Public sector personnel in violation of the requirement for a Green Pass will be noted as an unjustified absence and upon the fifth day of unjustified absence will be suspended without pay until a Green Pass is presented. Private sector workers in violation of the requirement for a Green Pass are to be suspended without pay. Employers with less than 15 employees may temporarily substitute employees without a Green Pass until a Green Pass is presented. In any case, no disciplinary action can be taken and employees shall not be terminated.<br>
• The availability of rapid antigen tests at pharmacies is to be guaranteed until 31 December at contained state-established prices (8 EUR for minors, 15 EUR for adults, and free for vulnerable categories).<br>
•        A Green Pass from a molecular (PCR) test will have a validity of 72 hours while antigen tests will continue to be valid for 48 hours.<br>
From 1 September-31 December 2021, Green Passes will be required in the following additional contexts within Italy: <br>
•        Educational system: all educational personnel and university students must present a Green Pass<br>
•        Domestic transportation aboard:<br>
o        Airplanes<br>
o        Boats and ferries for interregional transport, with the exception of the route across the Strait of Messina.<br>
o        Intercity, Intercity Notte, and high speed trains<br>
o        Buses traveling along interregional routes<br>
o        Buses used for rental services, excluding those used in additional local and regional public transport services<br>
In line with an ordinance from the Ministry of Health published on 23 June 2021, as of Monday, 28 June, in White Zones, it is no longer obligatory to wear a mask outdoors.<br>
The only exceptions to this are: <br>
•        Situations where it is not possible to guarantee adequate social distancing (1 meter) or where crowds or gatherings form<br>
•        While on the grounds of any healthcare facilities<br>
•        Whenever in the presence of individuals with impaired immune systems<br>
Please remember that you should still carry a mask on your person at all times and mask-wearing is still obligatory in any indoor spaces open to the public, including FAO Headquarters.<br>
The Italian government signed a new decree on 22 July, which takes effect today. It prescribes new criteria for the classification of regions, introduces the requirement for a Green Pass in additional venues within White Zones, and extends the state of emergency until 31 December 2021. <br>
*Classification of Regions: In terms of the new criteria for the classification of regions, classifications are now determined by ICU occupancy rates and overall rates of hospitalization for patients with COVID-19: <br>

Interior Minister Mazen Faraya said restrictions on Syrian transit cargo to Gulf markets and Iraq through Jordan will also be lifted, which Damascus has been pushing for.

 *Quarantine requirements: Anyone entering New Zealand (except from within a quarantine-free travel bubble, currently arranged with Australia and the Cook Islands) needs to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community. <br>
From 19 April 2021 travellers who have been in Australia for 14 days can travel by air to New Zealand without having to enter a managed isolation facility. Please see the New Zealand government COVID-19 website for details. <br>
Anyone travelling to New Zealand (except travel from within a quarantine-free travel bubble) will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine. <br>
Travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility. For more information see <a href=""https://www.miq.govt.nz/travel-to-new-zealand/secure-your-place-in-managed-isolation/"">‘Secure your place in managed isolation’</a>
Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher in advance. Space in managed isolation is limited and the New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=""https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/""> Managed Isolation Allocation System</a>
 website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls"">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.

*Transiting in South Korea: All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. <br>
*Testing / screening on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test declaration, issued within 72 hours prior to departure. <br>
All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. <br>
If you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you can apply for a ‘quarantine exemption’ which allows you to bypass quarantine when entering South Korea. The process of applying for a quarantine exemption varies depending on where you were vaccinated and the purpose of your travel. <br>
If you have a Korean government-approved official vaccination certificate showing that you had received two vaccine doses in South Korea more than 14 days before you departed from South Korea, you may be exempted from compulsory quarantine on your return. Arrivals from certain countries are not eligible for this exemption – if you are resident in South Korea, you should check with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency by calling 1339 (support is available in English) before you travel. 
If you were vaccinated outside of South Korea and are travelling for “humanitarian” purposes (to attend a funeral or to visit family), you can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. Any Foreign family relationship certificates (i.e. marriage or birth certificates) that you submit as part of your application need to be legalised (or “apostilled”). If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test issued within 72 hours prior to departure. You will also need to take PCR tests on arrival and on day 6 or 7, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>
Quarantine is mandatory if you do not have a quarantine exemption. Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for 14 days. All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities.  <br>
For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). 
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status: For the purposes of applying for an exemption from quarantine, check with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in your country. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>. <br>
*Data collection: Individuals from the UK will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
   <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. Results are usually issued via text message within 1-2 days. <br> 
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. If you do not need treatment, you will generally be moved to a quarantine centre until you have received two consecutive negative tests. If you do need treatment, you will be moved to a hospital or treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. <br>
Individuals testing positive may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged. You may face additional costs if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won. <br>
South Korea currently has a four-level national social distancing scale. <br>

As the grace period has now passed, British Nationals who entered on visas need to ensure that they have not overstayed. If the overstay is no more than 72 hours on a business or tourist visa then please contact the British Embassy Consular section. If over 72 hours, you will need to approach your local migration office for further information as soon as possible. It should be noted that the local authorities do not always speak English. <br>

From September 1, use of the app will become mandatory for entry from other CIS countries (Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). Exceptions apply to travellers arriving in Russia from third countries through the territories of the Eurasian Economic Union countries in transit or with a short stopover. In these cases, travellers are required to have a certificate with a negative result of the PCR test. <br>

When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>
The Swedish government has taken the next step in slowly opening up for vaccinated travelers from outside the EU. The government decided that the EU Commission's list of approved vaccine certificates – i.e. certificates that are legally treated as equivalent to the EU's own Digital Covid Certificate – will apply in Sweden, too, reports the TT news agency. This currently includes certificates issued by North Macedonia, San Marino, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and The Vatican – but it could be extended to more countries in the future. Sweden intends to approve vaccine certificates as and when they are approved by the EU. The government's decision will come into force on September 20th.

Measures change frequently. You should check the current situation with local authorities and the <ahref=""https://www.facebook.com/thailandprd/videos/620249802706637/"">Thai government’s Facebook page</a> and <a href=""https://thailand.prd.go.th/main.php?filename=index"">PR website.</a> 
*Accommodation: Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking. <br>
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures. <br>
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there
*Health:  If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422. <br>
If you need a COVID-19 test, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has compiled a<a href=""https://service.dmsc.moph.go.th/labscovid19/indexen.php"">list of private and government-managed testing facilities</a> . These will provide you with a test and normally contact you afterwards with the result. Authorities may also contact you as part of their tracing process.
If you test positive for COVID-19 and have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, Thai authorities recommend that you self-isolate at home or in a community setting dedicated to this such as a school or temple, where you can receive appropriate care. This also applies to school age children. National Health Security Office (NHSO) provides medical support and services for home isolation. To register, you can call the 1330 hotline. <br>
If you have more severe symptoms Thai public health regulations require that you quarantine at either a hospital, hospitel (a repurposed hotel with medical capabilities) or field hospital. <br>
You should ensure that you understand your health care provider’s policies before you take a test as these will include where you quarantine and receive medical care if you test positive. <br>
In areas designated as dark red zones there is increasing pressure on medical services. You may find it difficult to access COVID-19 testing and medical care. <br>

 International Restrictions: <br>
President Biden imposes new international travel vaccine rules, lifting severe restrictions (Reuters, 26.10.2021).
Governor of Hawaii to welcome vacationers, business travelers starting 1 November as COVID-19 cases drop (AP, 20.10.2021).
U.S. government to lift travel restrictions for fully-vaccinated foreign nationals from 33 countries from 8 November (Reuters, 15.10.2021).
U.S. to lift border restrictions for vaccinated visitors from Canada, Mexico starting early November. The rules will cover land borders and ferry crossings (Reuters, 13.10.2021).
 **Entry to USA: It is not possible for most British nationals to enter the USA if they have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran, Brazil, China, South Africa or India within the previous 14 days. The US Government announced on 15 October that it would lift travel restrictions starting from 8 November for foreign citizens who are fully vaccinated with any Covid-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website</a>. We are waiting for further details on how this will be implemented at US borders. British nationals planning to travel to the US from 8 November 2021 onwards may wish to wait for further information to be released by the US Government. We will update Travel Advice concerning entry to USA accordingly. <br>
Those arriving from outside the above areas will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver to enter or transit the USA as a visitor. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website</a>  to determine which you will need. <br>
US citizens and permanent residents of the USA, certain specified close family members and certain other limited categories of visas holders (such as UN staff and diplomats) are exempt. They will still be able to enter the USA, subject to normal entry requirements. <br>
The CDC requires that all air passengers arriving to the US from a foreign country get a COVID test no more than 3 days before their flight departs and present a negative result or provide documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months to the airline before boarding the flight. If you are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine or a vaccine authorised for emergency use by the World Health Organisation, you should also get a viral test 3 to 5 days after travel. Unvaccinated people should get tested with a viral test 3 to 5 days after travel and self-quarantine for a full 7 days after travel. Those who have recovered from a documented COVID-19 infection within the last 3 months, should follow all requirements and recommendations for fully vaccinated travellers, except you are not required to get a test unless you are symptomatic. In addition, everyone should follow all state and local guidelines. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.</a> 
On 21 January 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order requiring masks to be worn on aircraft, trains, buses and at airports. <br?
*Quarantine requirements: For international arrivals, the CDC recommends that unvaccinated passengers are tested within 3 to 5 days after travel and self-quarantine for 7 days after travel. Passengers fully vaccinated with an FDA or WHO-approved vaccine do not have to quarantine but need to take a viral test within 3 to 5 days of arrival. If you are travelling domestically within the US, individual states and territories may have their own quarantine requirements. A full list of local quarantine requirements is available on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html"">CDC website</a>. You should check the list frequently as it is likely to change, sometimes daily, as rates of COVID-19 transmission increase or decrease. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: The USA has not yet confirmed that it will accept the  proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. You should follow the entry rules for unvaccinated people. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination. <br>
The CDC has stated that, in their guidance on what constitutes someone who is fully vaccinated, COVID-19 vaccines that have been listed for emergency use by the World Health Organisation such as the AstraZeneca/Oxford and Covishield vaccines, are recognised by the US Government. How this guidance is interpreted will vary depending on the locality in the US. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html""> CDC website</a>. <br>
*Entry for Green Card and Current Visa Holders: New and renewed Green Cards (a Permanent Resident Card) are not currently being issued. However, existing Green Cards remain valid, although individuals who have been away from the USA for a substantial period of time should check their validity with their nearest US Embassy or Consulate before traveling. Further details are on the <a href=""https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-we-grant-your-green-card"">US Citizens and Immigration Services website</a>  . <br>
Those with existing visas remain valid as long as the holders are in the USA. All current visa holders based in the USA wishing to travel to the  any country covered by the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/proclamation-on-the-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-non-immigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease/"">Presidential Proclamation</a >  are strongly advised to check before they travel as to whether they would need an exception to re-enter the USA. The US authorities only consider applications for these once you have left the USA, so applying before travel is not possible. <br>
Students travelling from the UK (and the Schengen Area and Ireland) with valid F-1 and M-1 visas, do not need to seek a national interest exception to travel. <br>
*New Visas and Humanitarian Exceptions: The US authorities are only providing emergency and mission-critical visa services at present and visa appointments remain limited. Due to the impact of COVID-19, their visa services and travel restrictions may change rapidly. If you have an urgent need to travel, you can <a href=""https://uk.usembassy.gov/visas/visa-information-services/contact-us-immigrant-visas/u-s-embassy-london-visa-unit-contact-form/"">contact the US Embassy</a> to ascertain if you might qualify for an economic interest, humanitarian, or other exception. However, the criteria for these exceptions are very strict and you should be ready to provide as much information as possible to support your application if you apply for one. Should you not meet the current criteria for an exception, existing appointments for non-urgent non-immigrant visas may be cancelled at short notice. You should continue to check the US Embassy website for any changes. <br>
*Transiting USA: You cannot enter or transit the USA if you have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran, Brazil, China, or South Africa within the previous 14 days. For further information, please check the advice from <a href=""https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/"">US Customs and Border Protection website. </a> Those transiting to the USA from outside these areas will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website</a> to determine which you will need. US citizens and permanent residents of the USA, certain specified close family members and certain other limited categories of visa holders (such as UN staff and diplomats) are exempt. They will still be able to enter the USA, subject to normal entry requirements. <br>
All passengers transiting the USA by air are asked that they take a COVID test 1-3 days before travelling. All passengers must follow state and local COVID safety requirements, including mask wearing and social distancing. <br>

 *Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
On 21 January 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order requiring masks to be worn on airplanes, trains, buses and at airports. <br>
Some states have rules in place requiring travellers from other states, with high rates of COVID-19, to quarantine for 14 days or to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html"">CDC website</a>  . <br>
A number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public. These will vary from state to state. You should consult the website of the state to which you are travelling. Contact details are found on the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">US.GOV site  </a>. <br>
Further restrictions will vary locally with some states relaxing lockdown procedures while others are pausing or reversing their re-openings. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are re-opening across the USA but will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations.
*Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some may require proof of vaccination. You should be aware that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. You should follow local media and any guidance issued by local authorities. <br>
On 9 September 2021 President Biden announced details of a 6-pronged national COVID-19 action plan. This includes requiring all employers with over 100 employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly. You can find details and requirements of the White House COVID-19 plan on the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/"">White House website</a>. <br>
*If you test positive while in the USA you will be required to quarantine in a private area, likely a hotel or private residence. The length of time will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing. This applies to those under 18 as well. You may also be contacted by local authorities to advise to isolate if you were in close contact with someone else who tested positive. Any assistance for those required to isolate will depend on the local authority. You should check the  <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"" >CDC travel planner</a> to verify local state guidance.
