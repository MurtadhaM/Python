Theyre split into two groups which alternately rise up and down, imitating the human stride. Attached sensors help control how the building moves forward, said Lan, whose company Shanghai Evolution Shift developed the new technology in 2018.\"Its like giving the building crutches so it can stand up and then walk,\" he said.A timelapse shot by the company shows the school inching laboriously along, one tiny step at a time.According to a statement from the Huangpu district government, the Lagena Primary School was constructed in 1935 by the municipal board of Shanghais former French Concession. It was moved in order to make space for a new commercial and office complex, which will be completed by 2023.Workers had to first dig around the building to install the 198 mobile supports in the spaces underneath, Lan explained. After the pillars of the building were truncated, the robotic \"legs\" were then extended upward, lifting the building before moving forward.Over the course of 18 days, the building was rotated 21 degrees and moved 62 meters (203 feet) away to its new location. The relocation was completed on October 15, with the old school building set to become a center for heritage protection and cultural education.The project marks the first time this \"walking machine\" method has been used in Shanghai to relocate a historical building, the government statement said.Decades of destructionIn recent decades, Chinas rapid modernization has seen many historic buildings razed to clear land for gleaming skyscrapers and office buildings. But there has been growing concern about the architectural heritage lost as a result of demolition across the country.Some cities have launched new preservation and conservation campaigns including, on occasion, the use of advanced technologies that allow old buildings to be relocated rather than demolished.Official indifference toward historic architecture can be traced back to the rule of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong. During the disastrous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, innumerable historic buildings and monuments were destroyed as part of his war on the \"Four Olds\" (old customs, culture, habits and ideas).Maos death in 1976 saw calls for architectural conservation reemerge, with Chinas government granting protected status to a number of structures before passing a heritage preservation law in the 1980s. In the years that followed, buildings, neighborhoods and even entire towns were given state support to maintain their historic appearances.Nonetheless, relentless urbanization has continued to pose a significant threat to architectural heritage. The sale of land is also a key source of revenue for local governments, meaning that buildings with architectural value are often sold off to property developers for whom conservation is not a priority.In the capital Beijing, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of its historic alleys and traditional courtyard homes were destroyed between 1990 and 2010, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.In the early 2000s, cities including Nanjing and Beijing -- prompted by critics protesting the loss of old neighborhoods -- drew up long-term plans to preserve what was left of their historic sites, with protections introduced to safeguard buildings and restrict developers.These conservation efforts have taken different forms. In Beijing, a near-ruined temple was transformed into a restaurant and gallery, while in Nanjing, a cinema from the 1930s was restored to resemble its original form, with some additions outfitting it for modern use. In 2019, Shanghai welcomed Tank Shanghai, an arts center built in renovated oil tanks.\"Relocation is not the first choice, but better than demolition,\" said Lan, the Shanghai primary schools project supervisor. \"Id rather not touch the historical buildings at all.\"He added that to relocate a monument, companies and developers have to go through strict regulations, such as getting approval from government at various levels.Building relocations he said however, are \"a viable option.\" \"The central government is putting more emphasis on the protection of historical buildings. Im happy to see that progress in recent years.\"Moving monumentsShanghai has arguably been Chinas most progressive city when it comes to heritage preservation. The survival of a number of 1930s buildings in the famous Bund district and 19th-century \"shikumen\" (or \"stone gate\") houses in the renovated Xintiandi neighborhood have offered examples of how to give old buildings new life, despite some criticism about how the redevelopments were carried out.The city also has a track record of relocating old buildings. In 2003, the Shanghai Concert Hall, built in 1930, was moved over 66 metes (217 feet) to make way for an elevated highway. The Zhengguanghe Building -- a six-story warehouse, also from the 1930s -- was then shifted 125 feet (38 meters) as part of a local redevelopment in 2013.There are a few ways to go about moving a building: It can slide down a set of rails, or be pulled along by vehicles, for instance.But the Lagena Primary School, which weighs 7,600 tons, posed a new challenge -- its T-shaped, whereas previously relocated structures were square or rectangular, according to Xinhua . The irregular shape meant that traditional methods of pulling or sliding may not have worked because it may not have withstood the lateral forces placed on it, said Lan.An aerial shot of the Shanghai Lagena Primary School building. Credit: Shanghai Evolution Shift ProjectThe building also needed to be rotated and follow a curved route to its relocation instead of just moving in a straight line -- another challenge that required a new method.\"During my 23 years of working in this area, I havent seen any other company that can move structures in a curve,\" he added.Experts and technicians met to discuss possibilities and test a number of different technologies before deciding on the \"walking machine,\" Xinhua said.Lan told CNN he couldnt share the exact cost of the project, and that relocation costs will differ case by case.\"It cant be used as a reference, because we have to preserve the historical building no matter what,\" he said. \"But in general, its cheaper than demolishing and then rebuilding something in a new location.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/shanghai-relocate-building-preservation-intl-hnk-scli/index.html"}, {"title": "Self-driving robotaxis are taking off in China", "data_published": "2020-12-03T05:47:52Z", "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars for years . In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.On Thursday, AutoX, an-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside.This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isnt restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the citys downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin.It also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.AutoX demonstrating its driverless robotaxis on the roads in Shenzhen. Credit: AutoX\"Its a dream,\" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. \"After working so hard for so many years, weve finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.\"Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. \"We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,\" he said. \"The AI software is better [now.]\"\"From a technical point of view, the car is ready,\" Xiao said. \"Its very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.\"AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called \"Professor X.\" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely wont change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.Race of the robotaxiWhile AutoX has claimed an edge in China, its not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.In October, Alphabets Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what its like to ride in a self-driving car.This year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.In June, Didi, Chinas biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.Baidu BIDU Recently, Chinese tech giantalso announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibabas Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app.The startups latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.Some of the companys lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.\"The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,\" he added. \"For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.\"China, home to the worlds biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.\"The bar is incredibly high,\" he said. \"Its extremely challenging, but were very happy.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2020/12/03/tech/autox-robotaxi-china-intl-hnk/index.html"}, {"title": "Travel to Japan during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go", "data_published": "2020-12-30T11:01:08Z", "content": "Editors Note — Coronavirus cases remain high across the globe.

While they will not need to self-isolate, they will need to provide details of their movements for the following two weeks and not use public transport.Japan will be entirely free of the \"state of emergency\" or \"quasi-state of emergency\" designations as of October 1. That is the first time since April that not a single prefecture will be in one of the categories.Under these states and quasi-states, prefecture governments were allowed to make restrictions about things like crowd sizes and restaurant hours. With those designations lifted, it is possible for venues like bars, malls and cinemas to reopen.Whats the Covid situation?As of October 8, Japan had reported 1,709,603 confirmed cases of the virus and 17,872 deaths. These numbers dont include any positive cases connected to the Olympics or Paralympics.The National Institute of Infectious Diseases says that about 70% of the Tokyo-area cases are the Delta variant.Japans vaccine rollout began slowly but significantly picked up over the summer.

Credit: Yoray Liberman/CNN\"By connecting an environmental issue to the (human) body, (it) shows the vulnerability of the body up against nature -- and also, in juxtaposition, the vulnerability of nature thats caused by the body,\" Tunick said. \"Mankind can affect a massive sea. And I think that showing this juxtaposition of the body -- very fragile -- against the Dead Sea, which is equally fragile, will bring a new energy to the work and peoples conversations.\"To the untrained eye, the clouds, dusty haze and gusty winds did not bode well for the shoot. But Tunick begged to differ. \"Theres nothing like misty mountains,\" he said, referring to the backdrop. \"The weather is perfect.\"Challenging shootsIn contrast to the chalky white participants, Tunick was dressed in black. He stood atop a camper van, hollering instructions to his \"art warriors\" through a megaphone. \"Everyone in the front, walk towards me,\" he said at one point. They dutifully obliged. \"Slightly more. Muscular man,\" he said, delicately, \"move that way.\"Tunick directs participants from atop a camper van. Credit: Yoray Liberman/CNNOne of those taking part was Gil Shavit. The 63-year-old engineer from Hararit, in northern Israel, said it was his second time at a Tunick shoot. Shavit felt \"fantastic,\" he said. Like everyone else, he wore nothing but white body paint.Another man with a smile on his face was Arads mayor, Nisan Ben-Hamo. Despite some protests by ultra-Orthodox residents, he said Tunicks presence was \"a great gift\" that put the town in the same league as Barcelona, Vienna, New York and other locations given the Tunick treatment. He hopes the artists visit will attract tourists, just as Israel reopens its borders following the pandemic. To that end, Israels Ministry of Tourism has contributed around one-third of the cost of Tunicks trip, with the rest coming from private sponsors and supporters of the museum.Tunick is also optimistic -- not to say relieved -- that as Covid-19 abates, life is returning to some form of normalcy. \"I thought my work would be finished,\" he said of the pandemic. \"I thought Id have to position stones in a giant field and start working on earthworks. I can keep it to peopleworks now, so long as theyre vaccinated.\"Thats not to say a Tunick installation is a simple process. For a start, he cant simply shoot wherever he wants. \"The only place where I can make my work in the Middle East is Israel,\" he said. \"If I was asked to do a work in front of the Giza pyramids by the board of tourism of Cairo, I would say yes in a heartbeat.\"Tunick pictured on location in Israel. Credit: Yoray Liberman/CNNTime constraints meant this latest installation was more limited than previous shoots. Tunick said numbers were also capped because he only had 200 cans of the special white paint.For the men and women who made the cut, the elements, rocks and sheer physical toll of posing naked for long periods of time were not the only challenges. In a country as small as Israel, there are other, more prosaic hazards.

Harsh temperatures lead to barren, sparsely populated landscapes beyond the reach of most travelers. This inaccessibility is what first drew Austrian photographer Gregor Sailer to the region.\"I like this raw atmosphere and this exciting light, where everything is exposed,\" he said in a video interview, explaining that the Arctic has \"always fascinated\" him. \"On one hand, the wilderness wants to kill you, and, on the other hand, life is possible and goes on. There are things happening in these remote places that impact us all, and its important for people to understand these developments.\"Sailers new book , \"The Polar Silk Road,\" explores the Arctic through an architectural lens. Over the course of four years, the photographer visited Canada, Norway, Greenland and Iceland, capturing images of some of the worlds northernmost structures.\"It was clear from the beginning that there was not much architecture in the Arctic, so I came back with relatively little material,\" Sailer said of his early trips. He later focused his attention on around a dozen remote scientific research facilities, military bases and centers for economic development and raw material extraction.The North Warning System (NWS), an air defense early-warning radar system built jointly by the US and Canada. Credit: Gregor SailerMuch like the region itself, these facilities are often austere and cold. Composed of sharp geometric shapes and exposed structural elements, their functional forms stand out against the bleakness of their environment.\"I want my work to show the extremely exposed nature of these facilities,\" Sailer said. \"I try to get the impression of the whole space I am working in, and then I decide which details are important to capture in order to give outsiders access to this space.\"Building in a barren landscapeWhile shooting the project, Sailer endured snowstorms and temperatures lower than minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit. He used an analog camera that is not reliant on batteries (which can quickly deplete in sub-freezing temperatures), giving him one less thing to worry about in extreme climates.Working with physical film still left the photographer vulnerable to the elements, as it can be easily damaged or lost. Nevertheless, Sailer prefers working in analog: \"Part of the game is risk. It increases my consciousness, makes me calmer and heightens my perception.\"At face value, the structures in Sailers images reveal little about their intended functions; antennae, satellite dishes and power lines suspended between radar towers are found in military bases and research facilities alike. But the photographer said his images are more concerned with exploring how architecture operates within the landscape.The EastGRIP research facility in Greenland, where scientists drill into the ice sheet to understand previous climactic conditions and the behavior of ice streams. Credit: Gregor Sailer\"I wanted to capture an emptiness that isnt empty. Its important for me that viewers feel the surroundings and the dimensions of this vast, surreal landscape,\" he explained, adding: \"I try to do that through overview shots (first), and then by going into the details, so the viewers can get a better idea of the function of these facilities.\"An awareness of space is pervasive throughout \"The Polar Silk Road.\" Sailers photographs emphasize structures color and shape, rather than their size, letting the emptiness give viewers a sweeping sense of the surroundings.Some of the buildings, like air defense radar towers in Tuktoyaktuk, Canada, are built from white or gray materials that blend almost seamlessly into the pale canvas of the sky. Other photographs depict small, brightly colored buildings that stand in stark contrast to their white surroundings, like those at the EastGRIP research facility in Greenland.Race for influenceThe Arctic may comprise large swaths of inhospitable land, but it is now the subject of growing geopolitical interest. Actors like Russia, the United States and, more recently, China are all racing to develop new shipping routes in the region.Fitting, then, that Sailer borrowed his projects title from Chinas Polar Silk Road initiative , a government-backed proposal to develop infrastructure and freight shipping in the far north. The books name, much like its contents, speaks to the competition and cooperation that have defined international relations in the region.Several of Sailers photographs focus on the China-Iceland Arctic Observatory (CIAO), a joint effort between the two countries to collect data on solar-terrestrial interactions in the polar atmosphere, such as auroras. Elsewhere, Sailer depicts the North Warning System (NWS), an air defense early-warning radar system built jointly by the US and Canada.The China-Iceland Arctic Observatory, the result of a scientific collaboration between research institutions in the two countries. Credit: Gregor SailerBut territorial claims in the Arctic are about more than self-defense -- they are about securing control of resources hidden below the melting ice, like oil and natural gas, writes Günter Köck, coordinator of the International Research Programs of the Austrian Academy of Science, in Sailers book.Take, for example, the remote Arctic settlement of Tuktoyaktuk (which forms a chapter in Sailers book) on the coast of the oil-rich Beaufort Sea. In recent decades, oil and gas companies have invested heavily in exploring and developing oil fields along the Beaufort coast. Then, in 2016, the Canadian government announced that it was contributing 200 million Canadian dollars ($158 million) towards a new highway that will \"decrease the cost of living in Tuktoyaktuk... increase opportunities for business development, reduce the cost of accessing onshore and offshore oil and gas opportunities, and strengthen Canadas sovereignty in the North,\" according to a government press release.Climate change is the motorThere is, Sailer said, a single thread weaving together the economic, military and scientific growth documented in his book: the looming threat of climate change.Many of the buildings he photographed in Tuktoyaktuk are under threat from the steady erosion of permafrost. With their foundations compromised, older structures are beginning to lean and sink into the ground due to the melting ice, he explained.\"Climate change is the motor behind all of the developments, and I wanted to document that,\" Sailer said. \"If the ice wasnt disappearing, these trading routes would not appear.\"Related video: Eerie photos reduce buildings to facadesSeveral of the facilities in Sailers book are dedicated to understanding climate change -- like the ice-core drilling sites in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, where international researchers analyze ice build-up over hundreds of thousands of years to better understand shifting atmospheric and weather patterns.Sailer hopes that, by publishing \"The Polar Silk Road,\" he can show the public how developments in the Arctic influence -- and are influenced by -- the changing climate.\"My job as a photographer is to go to these lesser-known places, where things that influence our society are happening, and bring these events to light,\" he said. \"I offer these pictures with a hope of sparking a discussion, and with the hope that people start thinking about these topics or considering the world around them in a new way.\"This article was updated to correctly identify the North Warning System (NWS).", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/gregor-sailer-polar-silk-road/index.html"}, {"title": "Paris Fashion Week Spring-Sumer 2022 Highlights: Designers presented a new sexy summer dresscode", "data_published": "2021-10-09T09:04:29Z", "content": "\"Back to business\" might have been the way to describe the latest edition of Paris Fashion Week if the clothing on display hadnt been so wonderfully inappropriate for most traditional workplaces.\"Back to business\" might have been the way to describe the latest edition of Paris Fashion Week if the clothing on display hadnt been so wonderfully inappropriate for most traditional workplaces.Locking in a trend that began to take hold in the preceding fashion weeks in New York, London and Milan, sexy, barely-there designs made an appearance at numerous runway shows and presentations.

To celebrate creative director Olivier Rousteings 10-year anniversary with the brand, an enormous show was staged within Paris La Seine Musicale on a river island, in the western suburbs of the city. The two-day event was part music festival, part collection unveiling. The runway show opened with a pre-recorded audio message from Beyoncé, praising Rousteings efforts to \"to keep pushing that door open wider, making sure that others can also have opportunities for reaching their dreams\" throughout his career.Meanwhile, Parisian fashion staple Saint Laurent returned to its show venue of choice, the Eiffel Tower, and Chanel sparked joy on Tuesday with an event that took the catwalk show format back to the 80s, when models would prance and twirl down the runway to the delight of shouty photographers who flanked the stage. In the show notes, the brands creative head, Virginie Viard, wrote that she used to \"love the sound of flashbulbs going off at the shows in the eighties\" and she wanted to recreate that atmosphere for today.Saint Laurent returned to its usual show location to present SS22.

Jesus College later established the Legacy of Slavery Working Party [LWSP] -- comprised of students and academics -- to further explore the history of the bronze, its links to the slave trade, and the morality of owning it.In November 2019, the college announced it would be returning the bronze to Nigeria after calling it a \"royal ancestral heirloom\" and stating that it \"belongs with the current Oba at the Court of Benin.\"Cambridge University said in a statement that delegates from Nigerias National Commission for Museums and Monuments and Benin would visit Jesus College on October 27 for a \"ceremony to complete the handover process and celebrate the rightful return of the Bronze.\"In a statement to CNN, Nigerias Minister of Information and Culture -- Alhaji Lai Mohammed -- said of the return:\"This gesture by Jesus College is a big step on the path of restitution for the hundreds of priceless and timeless artifacts that were looted from Benin City in 1897.\"\"I hope this commendable action by Jesus College will spur other institutions as well as individuals in possession of Nigerian artifacts to return them voluntarily,\" the Minister said. \"We will not rest until all our artifacts that have been illegally taken away are returned to their homeland.\"The Oba of Benin, Omo NOba NEdo Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II said of the bronzes return: \"We are indeed very pleased and commend Jesus College for taking this lead in making restitution for the plunder that occurred in Benin in 1897.\"We truly hope that others will expedite the return of our artworks which in many cases are of religious importance to us.\"Sonita Alleyne, the Master of Jesus College, called the decision a \"historic moment\" and said it was the \"right thing to do out of respect for the unique heritage and history of this artifact.\"Alleyne gave thanks to the LWSP \"for its diligent and careful investigation into the provenance of the Bronze\" and to the \"students who pioneered calls for this.\"The return of the Benin bronze to Nigeria comes as momentum continues to gather for campaigns for museums, galleries and other institutions across the UK to return artifacts looted during Britains colonial era to their nation of origin.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/benin-bronze-return-intl-gbr-scli/index.html"}, {"title": "Poetry is experiencing a new golden age, with young writers of color taking the lead", "data_published": "2021-10-17T09:48:04Z", "content": "Written by Leah Asmelash, CNNThere was a time, not too long ago, when many people could only name one, maybe two, poets -- often a long-dead White man named William Shakespeare, Robert Frost or Walt Whitman.Meanwhile, the Lincoln Center, which houses prestigious artistic institutions like The Juilliard School and the New York Philharmonic, named its very first poet-in-residence this year, Mahogany L. Browne.Though poetry has always existed and experienced waves of acclaim, the genre is finding new prominence in todays mainstream collective imagination, stripping itself of its previous relegation to sleepy high school English classes. And, for the most part, poets of color are leading the charge.In the past, poets of color werent always supportedOf course, poets of color -- from Phillis Wheatley to Sonia Sanchez and Joy Harjo -- have long lived and worked in the United States. But Tyehimba Jess, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and author of \"Leadbelly\" and \"Olio,\" recalled a time in the early 1990s when the idea of getting an MFA in poetry, or even being a working artist and submitting to literary journals, was completely foreign to him.Then, in 1997, Jess happened upon a flier for Cave Canem, a foundation working to support Black poets in the US. At the time, the foundation was in its infancy, and books by Black poets were few and far between, he said. But being in that community is what first motivated him to follow poetry in a professional way.\"What has happened in the last 25 to 30 years, is that there has been a renaissance of Black poetry and a lot of that is particularly due to the kind of work... of organizations and fellowships such as Cave Canem,\" Jess said, also naming organizations like Obsidian, a literary magazine dedicated to work from the African Diaspora, and the Watering Hole, a writing retreat for poets of color from the South.Tyehimba Jess won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry. Credit: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto/Getty Images\"All of these organizations have been striving and working through really tough times, mostly on the idea of hope and the urgent belief in the power of the word and also the urgency of poets ... bringing parts of our history forward that have been neglected, that have been really ignored for so long,\" Jess said.It is the work of these types of fellowships and organizations, Jess said, that has led to the resurgent moment were seeing now.As writers of color are supported in their work, and they go on to become professors or teaching artists or editors or published authors, they create paths for publishing other poets from marginalized groups. It is the embodiment of \"lifting as we climb\" -- and one reason why it may feel like there are so many poets from marginalized backgrounds seeing mainstream success.More people are reading poetry, mainly people of colorBut poetry, as an art form, might also appeal to writers from marginalized backgrounds more than other mediums. Its inherent rejection of any notion of a straight answer creates room for the messiness of the human experience, said poet Ada Limón, whose latest book, \"The Carrying,\" won the National Book Critics Circle Award. That space might appeal to certain writers over others.\"For those of us in the between spaces ... who are not an easy box to be checked, if your identity is a bit slippery, poetry is the place where you can go to explore that, and it becomes a profound interrogation of who we are as humans,\" Limón said. \"Its not just one way or the other, no one is trying to be right ... instead the poems are saying Yes, me too, Yes, this also.\"Poet Ada Limón attends Vulture Festival Los Angeles in 2018. Credit: Gregg DeGuire/Getty ImagesAnd in Limóns experience, writers of color or those in other marginalized groups have had to resist oversimplifying themselves or their identities -- a fluidity that translates more naturally to poetry than, say, a plot-driven novel. Because poetry as a medium resists a summary or a single answer, these writers may be more drawn to it as a form of expression, Limón said.Limóns point is reflected in readership data, too. Black Americans, Asian Americans, and other non-White, non-Hispanic groups read poetry at the highest rates, according to data published in 2018 by the National Endowment for the Arts.Still, overall, more people are reading poetry now than before. In the US, 28 million adults read poetry in 2017, the NEA found, the highest readership ever recorded since 2002. And young people, between the ages of 18 and 24, led the charge, with a readership that doubled when compared to numbers from 2012.Rupi Kaur -- whose second book of poetry \"The Sun and Her Flowers\" was published in 2017, the year the NEA collected its most recent data -- was undoubtedly a part of many young peoples internal poetry repositories. With a career that began in the early 2010s almost through word of mouth, as her signature short poems and drawings were rapidly shared on Tumblr and other social media websites, Kaur now boasts 4.4 million followers on Instagram and has three books to her name.Rupi Kaur sits for an interview with host Jimmy Fallon on June 25, 2018. Credit: Andrew Lipovsky/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesWhen asked why she thinks her work resonates, Kaur noted that her writing is very personal and, as a result, her audience can find themselves and their stories in her words.\"I delve into my own life. I talk about how loss, grief, and trauma have affected me. I try to come to terms with that grief by writing poetry. My books are simply a byproduct of that personal self-care process,\" Kaur said in a statement to CNN. \"And I think when anyone is extremely honest with themselves, that honesty can relate universally.\"Poetry has become more visible in the mainstreamPart of poetrys growth is due to its increasing visibility with mainstream audiences rather than elite literary circles.A lot has contributed to this visibility: podcasts such as Poetry Foundations \"VS\" and \"The Slowdown,\" now hosted by Limón, have helped, as has the increasing popularity of spoken word and slam poetry. The rise of highly popular young poets, people like Ocean Vuong or Morgan Parker, have also played a part, as have growing efforts in grade schools and colleges to teach the works of living poets.But theres one thing thats maybe helped the most: social media.\"For all its faults,\" Limón said, \"I think that social media has actually done one wonderful thing for poetry, which is provide access and in many, many ways allow for poetry to become completely accessible to anyone.\"Its much more different than just 15 years ago, she explained. From Instagram accounts like PoetryIsNotALuxury , which posts multiple poems daily from a wide-ranging span of writers, to living poets using social media as a way to spread their work (à la Kaur), social media has changed the way poems reach people.\"That allows everyone, if youre having a cup of coffee and going through Instagram, to actually have a profound experience with an Audre Lorde poem, or a Lucille Clifton poem,\" Limón said. \"That kind of one-on-one, in the moment connection with contemporary and ancestral poetry, its just huge. And I just dont think weve had that before.\"Poet Ocean Vuong during an interview with host Seth Meyers on June 12, 2019. Credit: Jon Pack/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesAnother shift, Limón said, has been the acknowledgement of the reader on the poets part. When Limón was in graduate school, she felt like poems had to be written for other poets, which changes the poem -- making it more abstract, or intellectual, she said. Now, theres more acknowledgment of a reader who may not be as familiar with poetry, which shifts the engagement of the work to the wider community.\"Theres a certain recognition that poetry is in conversation with real, living humans on the other side of it, not just with the academic side of it,\" she said. \"Thats been a huge thing.\"She gave an example: Most readers, she said, dont have to know the reference points of a Shakespearan sonnet to appreciate a contemporary sonnet by Terrance Hayes. But in the past, Limón said there may have been literary references or language within the poem that kept \"our poems for poets.\"Poets.org, which publishes a daily poem as part of its series Poem-a-Day, has seen its readerships for both the website and its daily poems grow every year since 2013, said Jennifer Benka, executive director of the Academy of American Poets, which produces Poets.org and Poem-a-Day.\"American poetry -- thanks to it being perfect for sharing on social media, the work of poetry organizations nationwide that offer free publications and events, and its diversity of voices -- has never been more popular,\" Benka said. \"During the pandemic, especially, weve seen many thousands more readers turn to poetry for comfort and to help make meaning of this moment.\"So far, in 2021 alone, Poets.org has seen a historic spike in traffic, with more than 1 million additional pageviews. That increase in traffic to the website is, in part, attributed to the success of Amanda Gorman at Januarys presidential inauguration, and the attention she brought to the art form, a spokesperson for the academy said.In this way, poetrys increasing accessibility and visibility have worked hand in hand, leading to rising sales and, naturally, rising interest.Chantz Erolin, an editor at Graywolf Press -- an independent publisher in Minneapolis whose repertory includes works by poets like Jane Kenyon, Tracy K. Smith and Danez Smith -- has also noted the \"current excitement for contemporary poetry,\" calling it \"thrilling.\"\"The poetry landscape is vast and varied, and the increasing frequency (and visibility) of breakout collections has not only meant an increase in sales, but in more robust opportunities for engagement with poets and the press,\" he said.Though the number of poetry collections Graywolf publishes has remained rather steady, when it last accepted submissions for a single month in 2016, the press received over 4,000 manuscripts, Erolin said.\"It is an amazing time to be alive in the world of poetry,\" Limón said. \"I really feel that way.\"And though some scholars may argue that the true golden age of poetry was a long-ago era, Limón has a different point of view: The golden age of poetry, she said, is this moment -- right now.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/poetry-popularity-rising-gorman-kaur-vuong-cec/index.html"}, {"title": "Why Jasper Johns has been 'miscast' as a mysterious artist", "data_published": "2021-10-15T09:53:20Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNAt 91 years old, Jasper Johns is one of the most important living artists today, with auction sales worth tens of millions of dollars and a seven-decade career credited with changing the course of 20th-century art.But the American artist has always been reluctant to engage with interpretations or even showings of his work, leaving curators to present it as they like -- and viewers to reach their own conclusions.His latest retrospective, \"Jasper Johns: Mind/Mirror,\" is a massive dual-city show featuring hundreds of paintings, sculptures, mixed-media works and prints, with one half on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the other at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA).\"Im not very interested in exhibitions of my own work,\" Johns told CNN over email. \"As Ive said before, the work is too familiar.\"Johns has spent his entire career shifting viewers perspectives on the illusory quality of artmaking, contending with the picture plane and the nuance of reproduction.Jasper Johns most recognized motif is the American flag, but he has often returned to the same symbols and themes again and again. Pictured: \"Three Flags,\" 1958. Credit: Jasper Johns/VAGA/Artists Rights Society/The Whitney Museum of American ArtGlance at his works and you see the familiar motifs he developed early in his career -- an American flag, a target, a series of numbers -- but spend time with them and you start noticing the textures and imperfections. What actually makes a flag? It is both a physical object and a concept, a duality we perceive but perhaps never consciously consider.A painting of a tabletop strewn with papers, one of which depicts the white speckled whirl of a galaxy, similarly toys with our perception. The image-within-an-image presents a swirling mass of stars that contains the vast mysteries of life, yet is itself contained within a canvas.Johns work has always toyed with viewers perceptions of what an image is. PIctured: \"Mirrors Edge 2,\" 1993. Credit: Jasper Johns/VAGA/Artists Rights Society/The Wildenstein Plattner Institute/The Whitney Museum of American ArtBy exploring the work of an artist who continually returns to the same symbols and ideas, \"Mind/Mirror\" is a journey into Johns own galaxy of visual touchstones, repeated across time and two physical spaces. The shows title references the themes of doubles and mirroring that are repeated across his work.\"Our goal was to make a single show in two halves that were complementary to one another, and that the sum would be greater than the parts,\" said the Whitneys chief curator Scott Rothkopf, who staged the show with Carlos Basualdo, senior curator of contemporary art at PMA. Rothkopf writes in the exhibition catalog that Johns approach helped usher in a number of new movements, including Pop Art, Minimalism and conceptual art.Time unfoldingIt is rare to see such a diverse span of work from a living artist in a single show (though, as Rothkopf points out, 94-year-old Alex Katz will have a similar honor at the Guggenheim next year). Time is central to any retrospective, yet it is especially potent in \"Mind/Mirror,\" unfolding not just over the course of the galleries, but like invisible strings between works that were created years and often decades apart.Images appear and reappear, like the \"Mona Lisa,\" Johns own wandering stick figures and the famous illusory drawing that is both a duck and a rabbit. A 2007 sculpture features a cast of choreographer and dancer Merce Cunninghams foot hidden among a grid of aluminum numbers; the original, cast 40 years earlier, hangs uptown in Lincoln Center.The artist often declines to discuss interpretation of his work, or the images that he reuses in his compositions. Pictured: \"Racing Thoughts,\" 1983. Credit: Jasper Johns/VAGA/Artists Rights Society/Jamie Stukenberg/The Whitney Museum of American Art\"His sense of returning to an image or an object and reconsidering it with the distance of time is an essential engine of his art,\" Rothkopf said, adding that this idea is especially pertinent for those traveling to see both parts of the show. \"Between these two cities, some people might have a day in between or a week or a month. And so how memory relates to perception and this passing of time, and this journey between these two places, had a parallel to some of the aspects of Johns art.\"\"Mind/Mirror\" was originally scheduled to celebrate Johns 90th birthday in 2020, but it was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Over the course of the past year, Johns said he had been \"working in the studio, for the most part, on a print that took a long time,\" as well as gardening when time and weather allowed. When the Museum of Modern Art in New York recently mounted a major show of Cézannes drawings, Johns attended, having loaned some of the works. He recalled that it was \"amazing,\" saying: \"I wish I could have visited it again.\" At the time of his own show opening last month, however, he was \"at home recuperating\" following a fall at his home.\"His sense of returning to an image or an object and reconsidering it with the distance of time is an essential engine of his art,\" said curator Scott Rothkopf. Pictured: \"In the Studio,\" 1982. Credit: Jasper Johns/VAGA/Artists Rights Society/The Wildenstein Plattner Institute/The Whitney Museum of American ArtThough Johns says he has no interest in the direction of his shows, he was not completely absent from the curatorial process, according to Rothkopf. In preparation for the exhibition, Rothkopf and Basualdo visited the artist every few months.\"We would talk to him about his new work, wed share ideas, wed ask questions, wed look at his archive -- and he was the number one lender to the exhibition,\" Rothkopf explained. \"Where he was less involved was that he didnt make any specific recommendations or decisions about what the contents of the show would be, or what the ideas to be explored were. So, he really observed this notion that hes the artist; he makes his work, and were the curators and our work is to make the show.\"Hes been miscastBritish artist Cecily Brown, who first met Johns in the 1990s and later joined the board of a foundation he co-founded in the 1960s, believes the media often misunderstands his work.The artists motifs can prompt guessing games -- they are sourced from art history, everyday objects, the media and his personal life, such as remembered floorplans of his grandfathers home or a photograph from Life magazine showing the hunched form of a devastated soldier. There has also been much speculation about the \"green angel,\" a form he has returned to in his paintings over the decades but whose origins he has declined to explain.\"I think the trouble with people feeling that theres a mystery to solve is that then theres going to be a moment where they feel like they got it,\" said artist Cecily Brown, \"And then what happens?\" \"Pictured: \"Summer,\" from \"The Seasons,\" 1987. Credit: Jasper Johns/ULAE/VAGA/Artists Rights Society/The Whitney Museum of American Art\"​​I feel like hes been miscast a bit about being so mysterious, like hes some sort of Holden Caulfield figure who refuses to engage,\" Brown said in a phone interview. \"I feel like the work itself is what he wants you to engage with... I think the trouble with people feeling that theres a mystery to solve is that then theres going to be a moment where they feel like they got it. And then what happens?\"The Whitney show forges links between Johns art and personal life -- works possibly reference the late artist Robert Rauschenberg, with whom Johns had a romantic relationship in the 1950s, while silkscreened newspaper details may allude to the crimes of his former studio assistant, James Meyer, who stole and sold his unfinished paintings. Artworks that evoke a keen sense of loss and grief fill the rooms, Johns own shadow looming like a spectral figure in several of the paintings.\"(Theres) this obsessiveness of making and remaking and going back into things whether its printmaking or just making dozens of paintings of the same subject,\" Brown said. Pictured: \"Painted Bronze,\" 1960 (cast and painted in 1964). Credit: Jasper Johns/VAGA/Artists Rights Society/The Whitney Museum of American ArtBrown said she relates to the \"restlessness\" and \"obsessiveness of making and remaking,\" and that, even with Johns most emblematic works, clue-seeking through his visual lexicon isnt the point.\"The meaning is always shifting,\" she said. \"The target or flag is really almost just a ground to contain this shifting meaning. And its a mistake to try and pin any of it (down).\"Johns first painted the American flag just ahead of the Vietnam War, two years after being honorably discharged from the Army. His flag representations have been continually mined for political meaning. But for a viewer in the 1950s, a visitor to \"Mind/Mirror\" today and Johns himself, the flag almost assuredly has different implications.Brown summed it simply: \"I think its all there for the looking.\"Top image: Jasper Johns photographed with his work at the Whitney in New York City, October 1977.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/jasper-johns-mind-mirror-whitney-pma/index.html"}, {"title": "Inside the Waldorf Astoria's $1 billion makeover", "data_published": "2021-10-04T09:29:29Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNThis month marks 90 years since the Waldorf Astoria first opened its doors on New Yorks Park Avenue in 1931, becoming the tallest and largest luxury hotel in the world during an inauspicious time, as the Great Depression cast its long shadow.The hotels famed Art Deco interiors have been the backdrop of countless galas and benefits for the upper crust, as well as the site of history-making conferences for international politicians.

While parts of the hotel are being restored to its original state -- rooms including the Grand Ballroom are protected by New York Citys Landmarks Preservation Commission -- much of the building is being entirely reimagined for the future. And, for the first time, the Waldorf Astoria will offer residential apartments to own, rather than lease, within the twin Waldorf Towers.\"In the section that I worked on, there was nothing which was landmarked, so there was no starting point, there was no nothing to preserve,\" said Jean-Louis Deniot, the French designer tasked with transforming the new apartments and amenities. (The hotel rooms, meanwhile, are being overhauled by Pierre-Yves Rochon.) \"I wanted to go more modernist...fresher, but still feel grounded.\"The amenities for residences will include the oasis-like Winter Garden, seen in this rendering.

The for-sale apartments will range from studios starting at $1.8 million to four-bedrooms starting at $18.5 million (plus two penthouses, prices undisclosed). The amenities accessible only to residents will include the skylit 82-foot-long Starlight Pool -- formerly the Starlight Roof where Ella Fitzgerald regularly performed -- as well as the verdant Winter Garden, a bar and lounge turned into a green oasis.\"Theres something very peaceful and appealing about the sense of serenity of being connected with nature,\" Deniot said.The Starlight Pool will be converted from the hotels Starlight Ballroom, where performers including Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra once sang.

But it is actually the second iteration of the hotel -- the first, established in 1893, was demolished to make way for the Empire State Building. The first hotel wasnt immediately beloved, with the Indianapolis Times reporting in 1928 that \"people all over the country laughed\" at the idea that it would offer 350 private bathrooms, calling the project \"Astors folly.\"Actress Marilyn Monroe and playwright Arthur Miller at the long-running Paris Ball. Monroe lived in the Waldorf Astoria for a year in 1955. Credit: Bettmann Archive/Getty ImagesThe hotel was in actuality two buildings -- the results of a proverbial measuring contest between two moneyed cousins of the Astor family. William Waldorf Astor, who became the richest man in America thanks to his fathers inheritance, built the Waldorf. Four years later, his cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, doomed to become the wealthiest man to die aboard the Titanic in 1912, built a taller hotel right next door. They eventually dropped the animosity and hyphenated the hotels name as well as the buildings, connecting the two through a 300-foot marble corridor dubbed \"Peacock Alley.\" Among its perks, the Waldorf-Astoria touted that it was the first to offer en-suite bathrooms as well as room service.But when the Waldorf Astoria started anew on Park Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, it was no longer in Astor family hands (William Waldorf Astor died in 1919), but in those of hotelier Lucius M. Boomer, who managed the hotel after it was acquired by T. Coleman du Pont in 1918. Following the sale of the site, the board of directors sold him the rights to Waldorf-Astoria name for a dollar as a gesture of goodwill, and he used the bargain to his advantage.Peacock Alley during the 1910s. The corridor, which connected the original two buildings, was a place for fashionable guests to show off their attire for the evening.

Suites have been named after Elizabeth Taylor and Winston Churchill following their stays, and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt kept an apartment in The Towers over a decade ago. The Waldorfs other famous long-term residents have included Sinatra and composer Cole Porter, who both stayed in Suite 33A -- Porter for 30 years, until his death in 1964, then Sinatra in the 1970s and 1980s. Monroe, meanwhile, occupied Suite 2728 for much of 1955, paying $1,000 a week for the pleasure (around $10,200 today).When former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower moved onto the seventh floor in the 1960s, they chose a floor below The Towers because of her fear of heights, according to the hotel. They had an elevator reconfigured to stop on their floor to give them full access to the Tower amenities.Adding new artThe Waldorf has retained some of its most famous objects over the years, including Porters 1907 Steinway piano. It, along with the hotels murals, mosaics and nine-foot lobby clock -- an intricate 19th-century timepiece commissioned by Queen Victoria for the 1893 worlds fair in Chicago -- will also get a refresh.Joining them now will be a new collection of artworks curated by auctioneer and art dealer Simon de Pury, showcased in the Towers shared amenities. The collection will only feature original art, including pieces from emerging artists such as Taiwanese Canadian sculptor An Te Liu, Korean mixed-media artist ​​Minjung Kim and Swiss painter Philippe Decrauzat.A rendering of the restored lobby with its famous 19th-century clock.

We made sure to select works that contextually highlight the architecture and décor.\"Renderings have been released of many of the new residential spaces, but the crown jewels -- the two penthouses designed by Deniot -- are still in the works.

Then, Salih teaches them how to develop and print their film, before helping them identify their best images.Though its challenging to keep the project afloat, with obstacles ranging from fundraising to acquiring darkroom materials, Salih hopes the effort makes a difference in his students lives.\"The great part of the workshop is to see children on the first day and the last day -- you can see the difference.

As Sprinkle and Stephens read their vows to honor and cherish the Earth, they asked the guests to take them, too. Each attendee was gifted a bag of soil and asked to inhale the scent.This \"Green Wedding\" wasnt the first time Sprinkle and Stephens would marry, and it was far from the last. Since their first union, a domestic partnership to one another in 2003, the performance artists have married the sky, moon, snow and sun, among other natural entities. They have staged ceremonies all over the world with hundreds of guests, even marrying the Adriatic Sea at the prestigious Venice Biennale.Performing as a high Aztec priest, artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña officiated the \"Green Wedding\" in 2008.

Credit: Courtesy of Lydia DanillerThe larger-than-life ceremonies may seem like parodies at first glance. But as playful as Sprinkle and Stephens can be, they are responding to weighty issues. The artists adopted wedding rituals as a vehicle for LGBTQ, sex-positive acts at a time when same-sex couples were not able to marry in the US, and for environmental activism at a time when it was becoming clear how dangerous the climate emergency had become.As artists, Stephens said, they use \"strategies of joy\" and \"absurdity.\"Their nearly 20-year collaboration has produced ecosexual performances, exhibitions, events and theory. A new book, \" Assuming the Ecosexual Position: The Earth as Lover ,\" details the entirety of their practice, from early projects on love and intimacy, to their annual weddings, to their documentary films like \"Water Makes Us Wet.\" (Their next film on wildfires and \"social fires,\" per Stephens, will be supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship.)Curator Jota Castro invited Sprinkle and Stephens to create a wedding performance at the Venice Biennale in 2009, so they decided to marry the Adriatic Sea, and invited artists from around the world to collaborate on the eight-hour ceremony.

The ceremony was a community affair; they declared their love alongside 33 other couples, both LGBTQ and straight. Sprinkle wore a silver disco dress and a feather-trimmed duster, and Stephens a silver tuxedo. The event included performances by the San Francisco Gay Mens Chorus and transgender choir The Believers.As the pair explained in \"Assuming the Ecosexual Position,\" it was then they realized they \"could mobilize the wedding ceremony ... as a means to engage further political conversation, build community, and generate love.\"\"Everyone knows the narrative of weddings, how theres the rings, the vows, the kiss,\" added Sprinkle. \"It really is a performance.\"Sprinkle and Stephens cut the rock cake at the \"Silver Wedding to the Rocks,\" which was produced by poet and performance artist Diana Pornoterrorista.

They collaborated with different artists at each event, and declined material gifts. (They also usually have someone voice an objection to the marriage, a tradition started by a friend who read a list of \"Top Ten Reasons Why Marriage Should Be Abolished,\" detailing how the institution is unequal and outdated.)Inspired by the work of their close friend and mentor, the performance artist Linda Montano, Sprinkle and Stephens assigned a \"chakra color\" and theme to each of the seven years they worked on the project. In the first year, 2004 (or the \"Red Year\"), the pair debuted a series of public cuddling performances and hours-long kissing sessions, hosted sidewalk sex clinics, and held their \"Red Wedding\" at a former burlesque club. In the \"Orange Year,\" they married their community, and guests came dressed as orange juicers and carrots. The \"Green Year,\" when they declared their ecosexuality, was the fourth year.\"Our love for each other just grew into love for community, which grew into love for the environment,\" Sprinkle said.In 2010, the artists married the moon under a full harvest moon in the Farnsworth Ampitheater in Los Angeles.

In their \"Blue Year,\" in addition to their Venice wedding to the sea, the artists married the sky in Oxford, UK. Their \"Purple Year\" followed, with both a nighttime rave-like marriage to the moon, and a daytime union with the Appalachian Mountains. The last wedding in the seven-year project was to the snow, in Ottawa, Canada, where everyone wore white in a deconsecrated cathedral just after a massive snowstorm.Though the \"Love Art Laboratory\" came to an end in 2011, they continued their wedding performances, even as they embarked on an ongoing series of projects through the E.A.R.T.H. Lab at the University of California Santa Cruz (where Stephens chairs the art department). The post-Love Art Lab ceremonies have included a punk-rock, all-black \"Wedding to the Coal\" in Spains coal country, and the \"Dirty Wedding to the Soil\" in Krems, Austria.The White Wedding to Snow in Ottawa, Canada, was produced by SAW Gallery in a decommissioned Catholic cathedral.

Just before the Covid-19 pandemic, a group called the Future Farmers invited Sprinkle and Stephens to marry the fog at UC Santa Cruz, and this September, artist and scholar Ewelina Jarosz will host a wedding between Sprinkle, Stephens and the brine shrimp of Great Salt Lake, Utah.\"Weve passed on the wedding torch to future generations and future brides and grooms,\" Sprinkle said. Their book even includes instructions on how to marry elements of nature, for those who want to host their own ceremonies. Following last weeks United Nations report, which delivered its most urgent assessment of climate change to date, the pair added over email: \"Generating more love for the environment ... is needed more than ever.\"Sprinkle and Stephens have long used their collaborative projects to bring joy amid injustice and hardship, to reshape peoples relationship with the environment -- and to make saving the planet a bit sexier.Top image: The \"Purple Wedding to the Appalachian Mountains\" in 2010, with costume designer Sarah Stolar.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/ecosexual-annie-sprinkle-beth-stephens-new-book/index.html"}, {"title": "Meet Belize's secluded Mennonites, a community frozen in time", "data_published": "2021-08-10T01:54:33Z", "content": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNNHomesteads dotting a pastoral landscape, families living by lamplight and men in straw hats riding horse-drawn carriages -- the scenes in Jake Michaels photographs could easily depict bygone times in the American Midwest. But not only do his pictures hail from the digital age, they were taken hundreds of miles away in Belize.The tiny Central American country is home to around 12,000 of the worlds most conservative Mennonites, a group of Christians that live in closed communities and shun modern technology including, in some cases, electricity. Dating back to 16th-century Europe, the Protestant sects members have since moved around the world in search of isolated farmland, and to escape persecution or attempts to integrate them into wider society.Belizes colonies date back to the late 1950s, when a group of over 3,000 Canadian Mennonites immigrated there from Mexico. Their arrival followed an agreement with the Belizean government, which offered them land, religious freedom and exemption from certain taxes (and, as committed pacifists, from military service).In return, the country has enjoyed the fruits of their agriculture. Today, Mennonites dominate Belizes domestic poultry and dairy markets, despite representing less 4% of the population.A husband and wife stand outside their home, with only the lush vegetation hinting at the photos surprising location: Belize. \"Seventy-five percent of the images could be presented in a way where you would never know its the tropics,\" said photographer Jake Michaels. Credit: Jake Michaels/Courtesy Setanta BooksHoping to document their traditional way of life, Michaels visited three Mennonite colonies in Belizes north -- Indian Creek, Shipyard and Little Belize. And despite the communities apparent aversion to outsiders, he found them surprisingly receptive.\"People were far more hospitable than I expected, and everyone was very understanding, even though my Spanish is not that great,\" he said in a phone interview, explaining that the groups mother tongue is Plautdietsch (or Mennonite Low German), though many also speak Belizean Spanish.\"A lot of time was spent without a camera in my hands. It was more about interacting, socializing and getting to know people before (the photography) even happens.\"Stuck in timeSpending time in Mennonites family homes and expansive farmland, Michaels discovered a world frozen in time (an idea alluded to by the title of his new book , \"c.1950\"). But beyond the obvious anachronisms of technology-free homes and women dressed in bonnets, the resulting photographs hint at an idyllic life centered on family -- and free from the trappings of modernity.\"My whole practice shifted as the days like went on. My mind slowed down, and I was more present in the surroundings,\" he said, adding: \"Im not trying to say that their lives are simple, but I think it, for me, it just allowed me to slow down and be more present.\"Belizes Mennonites still travel by horse and cart. Credit: Jake Michaels/Courtesy Setanta BooksBut the photographer was also wary of romanticizing this remote way of life.Permitted to run their own schools, Belizes Mennonites have literacy rates significantly lower than the countrys other ethnic groups, with just 5% completing formal secondary education. The communities are mostly reliant on commercial agriculture, with colonies organized not only around family and religion, but also labor.Michaels photographs detail these economic realities. They depict Mennonites sorting beans in a dimly-lit room or in plastic aprons at a papaya-packing factory. Other images show men attending a nearby auction and smoke rising into a bright blue sky as land is cleared for farming.\"Their world intersects far more now with the modern world than it did before,\" Michaels said. \"There are several Mennonites who work in tandem with Belizean people, so theyre aware of the outside world and whats going on.Mennonites, pictured here sorting beans, rely on commercial agriculture, despite their isolation from wider Belizean society. Credit: Jake Michaels/Courtesy Setanta Books\"There are good aspects to life, and there are hard aspects to life,\" the photographer added. \"At the end of the day, people are still making a living ... people still have jobs. So, I think it was important to show the whole spectrum of life.\"Picture of contrastsLike Mennonites elsewhere, Belizes colonies have both conservative and progressive members, resulting in differing attitudes towards technology. Somewhat unexpectedly, electronic gadgets like cellphones and cameras make occasional appearances in some of Michaels pictures.It is a contrast he exploits to powerful effect. Take the image of a young woman in traditional clothing pointing a small digital camera towards Michaels own lens, a photo he described as \"one of my favorites from the whole trip.\"\"Everything about it seems as if its a photo from like the 1950s, but then theres a modern camera in her hand,\" he said, adding that the gradual creep of technology was not necessarily perceived as a threat. \"Theyre far away in the rolling hills of Belize, so its not like there are (competing lifestyles nearby).\"Consumer electronics make occasional appearances in Michaels photographs. \"Technology exists there,\" he said. \"Its not a complete bubble.\" Credit: Jake Michaels/Courtesy Setanta BooksAnd although the experience has not prompted Michaels to forgo technology himself, it has left a lasting impression on his photography.\"It definitely impacted the way that I shoot going forward,\" he added. \"It made me more interactive and more social with people rather, than just taking photos.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/belize-mennonites-jake-michaels/index.html"}, {"title": "The celebrity photographer who refuses to Photoshop movie icons", "data_published": "2021-09-03T09:27:35Z", "content": "Written by Megan C. Hills, CNNCelebrity photographer Andy Gotts has snapped numerous stars, from Hollywood titans Al Pacino, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts to promising newcomers like Anya Taylor-Joy and Nathalie Emmanuel. But one picture stands out to him as the most poignant of his career: a portrait of the late Tony Curtis, his face painted with an American flag.The British photographer recalled years of begging the actors agent to set up a shoot. After multiple rejections, he found a phone number for Curtis wife, and she picked up. A shoot was arranged for the next day.That night, however, Curtis called Gotts. The aging star, who suffered from various health issues and was using a wheelchair at the time, said he was feeling unwell.\"(He said), I dont feel good at all. But I will honor our commitment tomorrow, if you make me one promise,\" Gotts recounted in a video interview. \"I said, Anything, anything.\"He said, Will you make me look like an icon one more time? And I said I would do my utmost.\"Tony Curtis by Andy Gotts Credit: Andy GottsIt was the last portrait ever captured of Curtis, according to Gotts, who said the actor saw the photograph just hours before his death and had declared it \"the best ever taken of me.\" Characteristic of Gotts muted, shadowy style, the image sees catchlights glimmering in the actors eyes as he stares out with a painted face.The image is among dozens of celebrity portraits featured in Gotts new exhibition \"Icons,\" which is now open in London, and an accompanying book of the same name. In a career spanning three decades, the photographer has become a favorite among celebrities for his distinctive style and low-key photo shoots.A portrait of Harrison Ford by celebrity photographer Andy Gotts. Credit: Andy GottsWith lighting inspired by art historys Old Masters such as Caravaggio and Rembrandt, as well as cinema greats like Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean, Gotts works with an analog camera and no crew. His portraits are never retouched, unveiling actors \"facescapes\" with all their wrinkles, blemishes and smiles. Its a style that has remain largely unchanged since he first started.\"If you see a pimple on someones head, or a hair out of place -- thats because thats how they were, sitting in front of me,\" he said. \"I was capturing that moment when they sat down with me for our conversation.\"Over Gotts shoulder hangs a smoldering portrait of Kate Moss with glowing skin -- pores, minute lines and all. Stars like Kate Winslet, Naomi Campbell and Sir Ian McKellen have all embraced his candid style, but his aversion to re-touching images on Photoshop has been an issue for some, he revealed.One of Gotts portraits of supermodel Kate Moss. Credit: Andy Gotts\"There are these two iconic singers, probably the biggest in the world, who have both said to me, Andy, I love your photography (and) I own your photography, but you will never photograph me because youll show me as I look.\"Stripping downGotts was once assistant to celebrated photographers Lord Snowdon and David Bailey, though the experience had an unexpected impact: It showed him exactly what kind of photographer he didnt want to be, he said.\"If you think back to the late 80s and 90s, lots of portraits had glamorous backgrounds and were very ostentatious,\" he said.Gotts resisted the eras preference for staged glamour photography and instead turned to 60s-inspired plain backgrounds, which had \"fallen out of favor\" at the time, he said. Focusing his attention on subjects faces, his preference for black and white photography accentuated every detail while his style of overexposing and under-developing portraits helped create stark contrasts.\"Its essentially the landscape of the face that Im interested in -- the nooks and crannies, the peaks and troughs of a human face,\" he said. \"Thats what I love about it. Its all beautiful imperfections. Its fantastic, and no one was doing that.\"I thought, Well, if I strip it all back, its just a face,\" he continued.\"Mare of Easttown\" star Kate Winslet, who Andy Gotts counts as a close friend. Credit: Andy GottsWhile working with Bailey, Gotts also found that the photographer was constantly surrounded by a \"circus\" of assistants -- a debacle that left subjects feeling \"obviously bored,\" he said. \"I thought to myself, When I do this, it will just be me, no assistants. And Ill be really, really quick. So that was my idea when I started: quickness,\" he added.Actor Paul Newman went on to nickname him \" One Shot Gotts \" after the photographer captured the winning portrait on the first attempt. But aside from speed, Gotts ability to put celebrity subjects \"at ease\" allows him to capture more intimate, authentic portraits, he said. Chatting and telling rude jokes are both key to his method, which sees him crafting photographic moments through conversation. Gotts balked at the idea of a traditional \"very gray, drab studio,\" and instead shoots in a converted London hotel suite or at his subjects homes.He explained, \"Straight away, its like theyve gone to see a friend, rather than to a photo shoot.\"While Gotts sometimes has preconceived ideas for shoots, he often adapts to the situation. A pensive portrait of Robin Williams, for example, was taken as the late actor unexpectedly revealed how the death of John Belushi had affected him. George Clooney, meanwhile, was snapped at his Italian villa after unearthing a pirate hat from a party the night before.Other times, surprise guests completely changed a shoot. When Gotts first photographed Matt Damon, for instance, he had wanted to capture the stars \"really piercing eyes\" in an intimate portrait. But during the shoot, Damons \"The Brothers Grimm\" co-star Heath Ledger barreled into the room looking for a place to hide after he accidentally upended a make-up table. From there, Ledger did everything he could to make Damon laugh -- throwing toilet paper, blindfolding him with a scarf and hugging the actor.Gotts kept snapping through Ledgers photobombs. But the unlabeled roll of film containing images of the pair fell into the lining of his camera bag and was forgotten for years. When Gotts eventually found and developed them, Ledger had already passed away.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger laughing on set, after Ledger interrupted a photoshoot. Credit: Andy Gotts\"It was the only reel of film of Heath and Matt together, of these people messing about together... This moment in time was a moment where these two friends were bonding,\" he recalled.Gotts printed large copies of the photos and sent them to both Damon and Ledgers family. The late actors parents \"loved the pictures,\" he said, before giving him permission to share them in his new book.\"This is Heath,\" he recalled Ledgers parents telling him.Asking the right questionsGotts entry into the industry was as unconventional as it gets, but one that reflects his seemingly fearless approach. As a 19-year-old photography student, he interrupted British icon Stephen Fry as he was giving a talk to ask if the comedian would sit for a portrait. Fry rolled his eyes and told him he had 90 seconds. =The resulting black and white portrait ended up on Frys mantelpiece, where it was spotted by actor Kenneth Branagh. Next thing Gotts knew, he was photographing Branagh and his then-wife Emma Thompson -- kick-starting his career as word-of-mouth recommendations spread through celebrity circles.Photographer Andy Gotts first ever celebrity portrait, taken of comedian Stephen Fry. Credit: Andy GottsGotts hasnt stopped asking -- and getting -- since, landing photo shoots with Clint Eastwood by turning to Morgan Freeman for help, or asking Harrison Ford to act out emotions on cue. (The \"Star Wars\" actor told Gotts that nobody had ever asked him to be silly in a photo before, telling him, \"Everyones scared of me,\" the photographer recalled.)\"The worst that can happen is someone says no,\" Gotts said. And getting a \"yes\" from Stephen Fry when the photographer was, in his words, an \"absolute no one,\" he realized that nothing happens if you dont ask.Gotts name drops like a phone book, revealing that he called Harrison Ford an \"a**hole\" to his face, challenged Meryl Streeps lighting preferences and ordered \"Fleabag\" actor Andrew Scott to cry on cue. Calling himself a \"frustrated actor\" in another life (though \"more of a Danny DeVito\"), his early wish list was full of iconic film stars like Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, both of whom hes now ticked off. Tellingly, his exhibition and upcoming book are less about Gotts career and more about the icons who have held \"meaning in his life.\" Some of the celebrity subjects featured are now among his friends, while others were photographed multiple times, 10 or even 20 years apart.However, true icons are becoming harder and harder to find, according to Gotts. While there will always be A-list movie stars, \"iconic\" actors are stardust, he said -- especially in a world full of people pursuing fame.\"I dont think the word celebrity will be as important as it was 20, 30 years ago,\" he concluded.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/andy-gotts-celebrity-photographer/index.html"}, {"title": "The Arc de Triomphe is wrapped in fabric, a vision six decades in the making", "data_published": "2021-09-17T09:48:00Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNAfter three months of construction work at Paris famed Arc de Triomphe, the 160-foot-tall war monument has been completely concealed. The landmark, built during Napoleons reign, has been outfitted in 270,000 square feet of silver-blue polypropylene fabric bound with red ropes.Encasing the Arc de Triomphe in cloth was a longstanding vision of the late artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude -- one that finally came into focus this summer. It began with 400 tons of steel beams erected like a metal jacket around the structure, followed by the wrapping, which was conducted by a team of climbers over the course of a few days. Following the projects completion on Thursday, the arch will remain transformed for just 16 days.Sixty years after Christo and Jeanne-Claude first conceptualized the project, the Arc de Triomphe has been wrapped. Credit: Benjamin Loyseau/Christo and Jeanne-Claude FoundationThe unveiling of the installation, officially titled \"LArc de Triomphe, Wrapped,\" comes 60 years after Christo first became enthralled with the idea of wrapping the monument, more than a decade after Jeanne-Claudes death and over a year since Christo passed away last May . Originally scheduled for spring 2020, the project was first delayed out of concern for nesting kestrel falcons in the arch, and then because of the ongoing pandemic.Like many of Christo and Jeanne-Claudes other projects, \"LArc de Triomphe, Wrapped\" is poised to be a fleeting, sublime encounter with an environmental artwork that interrupts the experience of the everyday.Christo in his studio in New York City with a preparatory drawing for \"LArc de Triomphe, Wrapped\" in 2019. Credit: Wolfgang Volz/Courtesy Christo and Jeanne-Claude FoundationVladimir Yavachev, Christos nephew and the projects director of operations who worked with the artist for 30 years, explained that the shimmering color of the fabric and vivid ropes are Christos \"poetic interpretation\" of the blue, white and red of the French flag.\"He liked colors that also change with the weather, or the time of day,\" Yavachev said in a video interview, adding: \"The fabric is very reminiscent of Paris rooftops... which are very silvery gray.\"Transformative worksThe married artists (full names Christo Javacheff and Jeanne-Claude de Guillebon) became internationally renowned for ambitious projects like \"The Pont Neuf Wrapped,\" revealed in 1985, and \"Wrapped Reichstag\" in Berlin 10 years later.They used textiles to transform the natural world, too -- everything from an 18,600-square-meter (200,000-square-foot) orange curtain, hung between two mountain slopes in Colorado, to a series of islands near Miami encircled in bubblegum pink fabric. A series of thousands of saffron-paneled gateways in New Yorks Central Park, unveiled in 2005, was the last project they completed together before Jeanne-Claude suffered a fatal brain aneurysm.Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped The Pont Neuf in Paris in 1985. Together, they used textiles to transform different environments and interrupt the everyday at a grand scale. Credit: Wolfgang Volz/Courtesy Christo and Jeanne-Claude FoundationThe construction for \"LArc de Triomphe, Wrapped,\" which took almost 12 weeks of nearly 24-hour work, was a more intense process than people might think, said Yavachev.\"Its the perception of a lot of people that we just go there (to the Arc de Triomphe), throw some fabric and put some ropes (on it) and thats it,\" he said. \"But thats not at all the case.\"Christo and Jeanne Claude devised installations that could take decades to complete, requiring extensive permit approvals, legal hurdles and, often, environmental impact tests. (Some of the artists rejected or abandoned projects include wrapping the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, as well as suspending nearly 6 miles of fabric above the Arkansas River in Colorado.)Christo and Jeanne-Claudes projects included hanging a curtain across two mountain slopes in Rifle, Colorado. Credit: Wolfgang Volz/Christo and Jeanne-Claude FoundationChristo didnt pursue wrapping the Arc de Triomphe until 2017. Having declined the chance to carry out an intervention in the piazza of the Centre Pompidou, he said the only project he would consider in Paris was wrapping the Arc. In an interview with CNN just before his death, however, he confided that he \"never believed\" they would receive permission.\"I am an artist who is totally irrational, totally irresponsible, completely free,\" Christo said. \"Nobody needs my projects,\" he added. \"The world can live without these projects. But I need them and my friends (do).\"Monumental undertakingsAnne Burghartz, an engineer on the project, said her teams first task was to interpret the final form that Christo wanted. \"In his drawings, you can see the shape is not 100% the Arc de Triomphe,\" she said in a video interview. \"Its very boxy, it has vertical lines, whereas the Arc de Triomphe at the cornices, for example, is very pointy-shaped.\"They also had to determine how to keep the wind from dragging the fabric, while keeping it pliable to the elements. \"(Christo) was also very fond of how he imagined the fabric would come alive with the wind,\" she said.Though machinery and advanced technology were used in the planning and installation of the protective steel beams, a team of climbers carried out the wrapping. Credit: Wolfgang Volz/Courtesy Christo and Jeanne-Claude FoundationBut, most importantly, Burghartzs team had to protect the monument and all of its ornamentation, from the sculpted figures flanking each side of the entrance to the intricate cornices. Though the engineers had permission to drill some holes in the landmark they had to minimize damage. So, they installed wood panels between the steel and the archs concrete to protect it from scratches and built frameworks around its sculptures to keep them safe.\"​​Some of the statues have wings, they have swords, they have trumpets,\" Burghartz said. \"So we built these cages around the statues to protect them from the fabric, from the climbers and from the construction site work.\"To help build the outer structure, technicians used laser technology to survey the monument. The entire Arc de Triomphe was scanned by a drone, producing precise high-resolution images for the engineering team.Work at the site took around three months to complete. Credit: Wolfgang Volz/Courtesy Christo and Jeanne-Claude FoundationIn total, the project cost around 14 million euros ($16.5 million). But like all of Christo and Jeanne-Claudes projects, the \"LArc de Triomphe, Wrapped\" will, according to a spokesperson for the project, be entirely funded through the sale of preparatory drawings and other original artworks. Sothebys Paris is hosting an exhibition and private sale featuring 25 of the artworks, with proceed going towards the project and the artists foundation.\"For Christo, the most important thing was freedom,\" Yavachev said. \"He and Jeanne-Claude did not want to (give up their) freedom by accepting grants or money or sponsorship from anybody else.\"\"The London Mastaba\" on Serpentine Lake was a smaller version of Christo and Jeanne Claudes final, posthumous project, which will be built in Abu Dhabi.

The Mastaba, conceived in 1977 and influenced by the architecture of Ancient Egyptian tombs, will be made of 410,000 multi-colored barrels in the Abu Dhabi desert. Its a giant version of the last artwork Christo executed during his lifetime, a colorful mastaba sculpture in Londons Serpentine Lake in 2018. The Abu Dhabi installation will be the last major work that the artists team has the blueprints for, according to Yavachev.\"It might take another five years; it might take another 10 years.

Above the horns is a matching headpiece, and below, a pair of nipple buttons in gilded brass.This is not cookie-cutter fashion, as Roseberry calls it. This is something far more extraordinary.Schiaparelli haute couture Autumn-Winter 2022. Credit: Courtesy of SchiaparelliSchiaparelli haute couture Autumn-Winter 2022. Credit: Courtesy of SchiaparelliDresses are voluminous, shoulders are exaggerated, materials are lush and the detailing demands a closer look (signature jewelry items, the \"bijou\" as theyre known, come shaped like eyeballs, noses, hands and lips). The creations are all the more beautiful for their Surrealist references and an almost perverse edge.At first glance, its hard to imagine these designs coming from an understated, born-and-raised Texan -- one who says, without a hint of irony, that hed happily live in a cabin in Maine for most of the year and design clothes from there.\"My life. my personality and my emotional reality is in direct opposition to the work that I want to put out there,\" he says during an interview in his Parisian atelier , on Place Vendôme, days before his new collection is unveiled.When the then-33-year-old Roseberry, from Plano, Texas, was appointed artistic director of Schiaparelli, he became the first -- and to date, only -- American to lead a French couture house. He was hardly a household name at the time. Trained at New Yorks Fashion School of Technology, and with 10 years at Thom Browne under his belt, he had the credentials, certainly, but no experience at the helm of a luxury fashion house, no formal training in haute couture and no spoken French.Go behind-the-scenes with Daniel Roseberry at Schiaparelli. Credit: Win McNamee/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesHe also had the looming legacy of the houses founder, Elsa Schiaparelli, to grapple with. A true renegade, she was perhaps the most important and influential designer between the two world wars, a title challenged only by Coco Chanel, her arch rival.Born into an aristocratic Italian family, Schiaparelli rebelled from an early age by publishing a book of sexually-charged poetry titled \"Arethusa,\" the name of a nymph from Greek mythology. She was sent away to a Swiss convent but left shortly after going on hunger strike. Married and divorced by the early 1920s, she moved to Paris with her daughter where she lived a bohemian lifestyle and acquired a circle of artist friends. In 1927, Schiaparelli launched a fashion business out of her apartment, quickly expanding it and becoming more prolific and inventive.Ten years later, drawing on her relationship with Spanish artist Salvador Dalí, Schiaparelli created one of the most famous gowns in fashion history: the lobster dress . At the height of the Surrealist movement, the silk organza dress with a large lobster sketched onto the skirt was a symbol of the times -- and remarkably avant-garde.Elsa Schiaparelli and Salvador Dalí in 1949. Credit: Archives Snark/Courtesy of SchiaparelliBut Schiaparellis progressive designs didnt keep her out of the mainstream. In 1934, she became the first female fashion designer to feature on the cover of Time magazine, and later on she was even a special guest on the popular US game show, \"Whats My Line?\"After decades of success, Schiaparelli shuttered her business in 1954; it lay dormant until being revived by businessman Diego Della Valle in 2012.So when Roseberry walked into the atelier some two months before he was due to present his first collection for the brand in 2019, he must have felt intimidated? \"Ignorance is bliss,\" he says. \"When I started, I had 63 days for the first collection and I honestly did not have time for anxiety. I didnt have time for a nervous breakdown. It was so intense.\"Despite his baptism of fire, and two first years defined by the Covid-19 pandemic, the designer seems quietly confident. \"You know its funny,\" he says, \"I could lose sleep about going to a dinner party that I feel intimidated to go to, but Im not really losing sleep about my work. I feel really comfortable with what I do.\"Being an American gives me a sense of perspective,\" he adds, \"maybe even more of a sense of freedom.\"Roseberry has clearly spent time getting to know the house and the legacy of its founder. Hes well versed in Schiaparellis life, her contributions to the industry and her archive. Hes respectful of the history but is also focused on building his own creative language -- the new \"codes,\" as he calls them.Former first lady Michelle Obama in Schiaparelli at the 2019 American Portrait Gala at Smithsonians National Portrait Gallery. Credit: Paul Morigi/Invision/AP\"I think people have this notion of couture, that it exists inside of a glass box,\" he says, in reference to the exclusive nature of high fashion. \"And a lot of what Ive tried to do over the past two years is shatter those glass walls and really expose the process.\"Roseberry is a hands-on designer. From the early sketches to the final campaign shoot, hes present throughout the process, working intensely alongside his team. \"You hear stories of designers who dont come in, or they come into the studio once a month. I just cant imagine that,\" he says.During his debut runway show, Roseberry even planted himself on the catwalk. As the lights came up, the designer appeared sitting at his drawing table (a nod to his old studio in New Yorks Chinatown, where he sketched his first designs for the label). Models breezed past Roseberry, bringing his drawings to life while he continued to sketch live on stage.According to the designer, sketching is one of his secret powers. All collections begin with images made by Roseberry -- hes been drawing since he was a child, taught by his mother from an early age, and its become \"the bedrock\" of his creative process, he says.Schiaparelli haute couture Spring-Summer 2021. Credit: Courtesy of SchiaparelliWhen Roseberry got a call, some 10 days before the US presidential inauguration, asking him to design a look for Lady Gagas performance of the national anthem, he began sketching almost immediately. He made 12 drawings for the singers outfit that day.The final look, a large red silk dress with fitted navy jacket and an oversized dove-shaped brooch, came together in a matter of days. \"Its one of those moments that you dont really know the impact that its going to have on your career, and also on the house, until much later,\" he reflects, calling it \"an honor of a lifetime.\"The dress was originally supposed to be all white, but after seeing the initial designs, it was Gaga herself who suggested the red and the blue -- and it was \"so much stronger,\" Roseberry says.Of course Gaga isnt the only celebrity to wear Roseberrys work. Hes dressed Michelle Obama, Cardi B, Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé, who wore Schiaparelli to receive her 28th Grammy Award earlier this year.

He spent 10 days in quarantine in his Paris apartment after coming back from the US, and he drew every day, creating hundreds of drawings and \"working things out in mind,\" he says.What emerged from the early sketches is \"The Matador,\" his fourth collection comprising 26 different looks. In his show notes he writes that it is a \"collection that honors Elsas vision but isnt in thrall to it.\"Schiaparelli haute couture Autumn-Winter 2022.

One look in particular -- a mini dress with \"monstrous\" barrel sleeves embroidered in pink silk taffeta flowers -- is, Roseberry believes, one of the more literal examples of how he applied his new codes to the iconic Elsa Schiaparelli archive. The dress is a tribute to a jacket she made in collaboration with French poet and artist Jean Cocteau in 1937.The original piece features a sketch of a vase with pink flowers spilling out of it. \"Its repurposed and repackaged in a way that feels definitely an homage,\" Roseberry offers, but its a look that he says is in \"full control of the language of today.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/daniel-roseberry-schiaparelli-couture/index.html"}, {"title": "Decoding the Queen's colorful style", "data_published": "2021-06-11T08:37:02Z", "content": "Written by Leah Dolan, CNN Contributors Video: Angelica Pursley, CNN; Max Burnell, CNNAs Britains longest-reigning monarch, the Queen is both a cherished and consistent part of public life -- her image synonymous with stability and tradition to the British people.When masses gather and wait dutifully to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty, the color she steps out in is more important than you might think, too. Standing at 5 feet 3 inches, vivid hues like yellow, fuschia, purple, chartreuse and periwinkle make her easier to spot in large crowds. The Queens bold wardrobe is so distinctive, it has spawned entire books dedicated to recording each beaming outfit. In \"Our Rainbow Queen,\" Welsh journalist Sali Hughes notes Her Majestys color wheel considerations: \"(she) wont wear green to grassy venues, nor dark colours against dark upholstery.\"The monarchs commitment to a vibrant color palette is a sign of respect for those who take the time to support her in person. \"She needs to stand out for people to be able to say I saw the Queen,\" says Sophie Rhys-Jones, the Countess of Wessex, in the 2016 documentary \"The Queen at 90.\"The Queens official 90th birthday at The Mall on June 11, 2016 in London, England.

Over her 60 year reign the Queen has amassed an army of staffers, but few have been trusted with the task of royal dressmaker. British designers Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, Stewart Parvin and Angela Kelly have all helped develop her style -- steering clear of trend cycles that can quickly fall out of favor.Kelly -- the Queens sartorial adviser for almost three decades and a close confidante -- has created an air-tight formula that ensures every one of the her 300 annual engagements hits the mark. From fail-safe weighted hem-lines and wager-worthy hats, to extensively researched weather forecasts and local customs -- the Queens outfits are nothing if not judicious.The Queen during a visit to The Royal Australian Air Force Memorial on March 31, 2021 near Egham, England.

Not only do these mainstay accessories bring a sense of occasion to the Queens ensembles, they are a kind of sartorial crest on-lookers have come to expect and dissect -- with many eager to unearth sentimental stories behind each item. Take, for example, the hand-painted Centenary Rose Brooch commissioned by the Queen as a 100th birthday gift for the Queen Mother, which she in turn wore during a Christmas broadcast less than a year later after her mother passed.Her Majesty horse riding in Windsor Home Park over the UKs May bank holiday weekend.

Her off-duty attire is of equal importance, and often sets the mood for political arrangements. In 2016, when the Obamas arrived at Windsor Castle to meet Her Majesty for the third time, the Queen wore a silk scarf fastened under her chin (a defining feature of her more casual outfits), signaling familiarity and an informal tone.The Queen wearing the Rose Centenary Brooch in 2008. Credit: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty ImagesFashion statementsPoised, appropriate and always strategic -- the Queens styling choices are as much a form of diplomacy as they are an expression of identity.In 2011, Her Majesty became the first British monarch to visit the Republic of Ireland since its creation -- and the first to enter the country in a century.The historic state visit was not taken lightly, with tactful considerations infusing every detail of the trip right down to the stitches on her garments. The Queen masterfully demonstrated the soft power potential of fashion, arriving in Dublin wearing a green coat and matching hat -- Irelands de facto national color. Later in the visit, she donned a white, silk gown embellished with more than 2,000 hand-sewn embroidered shamrocks and an Irish harp brooch made from Swarovski crystals.Even in her early career, the Queen was well versed in the value of image-making and optics. Coming to power (and of age) during World War II, the young princess quickly became a vision of hope and optimism in war-torn Britain. She stoked those fires anyway she could -- carefully constructing an image that conveyed authority, elegance and decorum. One of the most readily available sources was her wardrobe.Her Majesty during her engagement to Prince Philip in 1947.

It was a gesture of commonality, although Her Majesty did receive 200 extra coupons from the government to help cover the cost. The gown, made of ivory silk and duchess satin with a 15-foot train, was designed by Norman Hartnell.Queen Elizabeth II watches as pallbearers carry the coffin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh inside St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021.

For instance, Cassils fast-tracked journey to an adonis-like physique, a performance titled \"Cuts: A Traditional Sculpture,\" rebelled against the idea that trans people require gender confirmation surgery to merit acceptance.\"When I (trained as a bodybuilder) in 2011, there were no words like non-binary or gender non-conforming,\" said Cassils, who uses they/them pronouns, in a video interview. \"If you were trans, which very few people were, you were (told to have) surgical alterations, or you were signed up for a life-long prescription of injectable hormones. And if you didnt do that, you were not considered trans -- both by society at large and even by the trans community itself.\"After almost six months of training five days a week, Cassils had transformed their body into a hyper-masculine sculpture without surgical intervention. The performance was documented in a video, condensing 23 weeks of grueling work into just 23 seconds, and a series of photos showing the artist flexing their lean, rippling muscles and pouting with a perfectly-painted red lip. The images posed a striking answer to the question of what it means to be a man.Cassils pictured following their intensive bodybuilding regime for the artwork \"Cuts: A Tradtional Sculpture\" (2011). Credit: Cassils with Robin Black\"Why is it that to identify as male, I have to surgically remove my chest?\" Cassils said. \"Why do I have to (take) a binaristic approach that is based in patriarchy and oppression? Why is my body the problem?\"A decade on, Cassils explorations of trans rights remain as relevant as ever. In a new dance performance titled \"Human Measure,\" which opened this month in Manchester, UK, the artist responds to the anti-trans laws currently sweeping the US. In April, 33 states proposed more than 100 bills that aim to curb the rights of transgender people, including banning trans athletes from participating in sports consistent with their gender identities and prohibiting health care professionals from administering gender-affirming care to minors.\"It is the largest assault historically in the United States, this stance on trans and gender non-conforming people,\" Cassils said.Despite legal setbacks, trans actors and celebrities have become increasingly visible in recent years. \"Euphoria\" actress Hunter Schafer has 3.6 million Instagram followers and has modeled for the likes of Prada and Calvin Klein. In March, six years after Caitlyn Jenner starred on the cover of Vanity Fair following her transition, actor Elliot Page became the first trans man to appear on the cover of Time magazine.But this shift in media representation doesnt equate to civil rights, Cassils argued: \"What does it mean to create representation in this moment where we have a society thats actively trying to destroy and erase you?\"The live performance of \"Human Measure.\" Credit: Cassils with Manuel VasonCassils response unfolds in a darkened theater at Manchesters HOME cultural center, where the artist and a cohort of dancers perform illuminated only by a dim red light.\"(The light) has many different meanings to me,\" Cassils said. \"Everything from a siren, to blood, to emergency, to this idea of (photographic) development.\"\"Human Measure\" also riffs on the idea of visibility, both literally and metaphorically. By casting gender non-conforming dancers, Cassils defied heteronormative expectations and eliminated the pressures of filling traditional male and female roles.\"Young dancers, specifically, who are gender non-conforming are often forced to change their external (appearance) to placate more normative gender prescriptions,\" said Cassils. \"So this has been a process of allowing each (dancer) involved to bring that variance.\"An unorthodox educationFor someone whose practice is built on the unconventional, Cassils grew up with a somewhat traditional view of art making. \"I thought to be an artist meant to be a painter,\" they said, \"because I didnt know anything else.\"This orthodoxy was challenged as soon as the Canadian artist arrived at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD), a school that became renowned for its experimental approach in the 1960s and 70s. \"It was taken over by (a group of) radical, draft-dodging US conceptual artists from New York,\" Cassils said. \"I showed up knowing nothing about that world, and then just being really intoxicated by (progressive art).\"NSCADs avant-garde makeover has gone down in art history. It was led by the late conceptual artist Garry Neill Kennedy, who, after being hired as college president in 1967, replaced much of the teaching staff with a roster of visiting artists including German painter Gerhard Richter and American sculptor Robert Smithson.\"(Kennedy) really had turned that school into a place of radical experimentation,\" said Cassils. \"It led me onto a path. I started to see how powerful it could be to take things outside of a gallery setting and into the streets -- into places where, perhaps, there were folks who felt alienated or ostracized by the edifices of museums or galleries.\"I will do whatever it takesNow in the third decade of their art career, Cassils could be excused for shying away from physically demanding performances like \"Becoming an Image,\" in which they punch and kick a huge block of clay in total darkness.But the artist believes that aging enriches, rather than restricts, their work.\"\"Its why I performed Becoming an Image over and over again,\" they said. \"Already, since 2012, Ive seen through photographs that theres this aging process you can see in my body, which is incredible. So you see this Sisphysian act of this person pummeling clay up and down. And already Im seeing this as a masterwork that I might release in my 80s.\"There are some limits, however. For instance, \"Inextinguishable Fire,\" a 2015 performance in which Cassils entered a state of temporary hypothermia before being set on fire at the National Theatre in London, will never be performed again -- if only for fear of excruciating medical bills, they said.Cassils engulfed in flames as part of the performance work \"Inextinguishable Fire\" (2015) at the National Theatre in London. Credit: Cassils/Robin Black/Courtesy of the artistEverything else, though, is up for discussion. \"It depends on the work. I think of my body as both an instrument and an image,\" said Cassils. \"Just like a painter works very hard to refine a brushstroke, theres a sort of analog training protocol to my practice.\"When training for \"Inextinguishable Fire,\" Cassils would jog up a hill carrying a backpack filled with watermelons in an effort to improve their breathing control (inhaling at any point during the 14-second performance would char their esophagus). For \"Becoming an Image,\" meanwhile, Cassils conditioned their body for impact by taking martial art sessions four times a week for several months before the performance.\"People say, Oh, he must be exhausted,\" they said. \"Im like, No, I could actually do it three times more.\"So what pushes Cassils to such demanding physical extremes when they are, in their words, \"not competitive\"?\"Its not about winning for me. I am driven, and thats different. I see being an artist as being a service provider. And I will do whatever it takes to create something that is meaningful and that can make the world a safer and better place for people.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/cassils-artist-profile/index.html"}, {"title": "Meet the K-pop stars taking on the art world", "data_published": "2021-10-08T01:34:21Z", "content": "Written by Megan C. Hills, CNNAt first glance, the three names beside a series of surreal high-contrast paintings, moody black and white photographs and Jackson Pollock-esque splatters might not jump out among over 70 artists appearing at a London art fair next week.But fans of K-pop may recognize at least one of them: Henry Lau, a Chinese-Canadian singer who rose to fame with South Korean boyband, Super Junior. Reversing another of the artists names, Ohnim, meanwhile reveals his identity as rapper Mino, a member of popular K-pop group Winner. His bandmate Kang Seung-Yoon is flying under the radar using the pseudonym Yooyeon.The three performers have all forged successful careers in South Koreas burgeoning music industry. Now, they are attempting to crack an even tougher market: the elite world of contemporary art.The trio may not be short of potential buyers when their art goes on show at StART , a five-day fair at Londons Saatchi Gallery. Keen-eyed Winner fans have already offered Mino -- who asked to be referred to as Ohnim for this piece -- thousands of dollars for one of his original paintings. However, speaking via video call from Seoul, the rapper said he was hesitant about selling his work publicly.\"Tons of my fans keep offering all kinds of prices for a piece, because theyre fans,\" he said via a translator. \"But I dont want to do that. I want to actually belong in the art world and it be recognized by critics that my artwork is (worth) a certain price. I dont want to take advantage of my fans... I have to take care of them.\"Ohnims fellow Winner band member and photographer Kang Seung-Yoon, who goes by the artist moniker Yooyeon. Credit: From YG K Plus/StART Art GlobalWhen StART founder David Ciclitira spoke to Ohnim, Yooyeon and Lau about selling their art, they were at a loss for how to value them -- or even whether to sell them at all. (Ciclitira, a prolific collector of Asian art, purchased one of Ohnims paintings ahead of the fair, but declined to disclose how much he paid, saying via video call: \"They were just so excited that someone wanted to buy something.\") With some persuasion, the musicians compromised and agreed to produce 250 limited-edition prints (signed and priced at $500) for the fair, as well as an affordable range of face masks, mugs and tote bags.The popstars involvement with StART will undoubtedly attract new eyes to their work -- especially in Western markets where they are far from household names. But the relationship is mutually beneficial. Ahead of the fair, they have been excitedly sharing flyers and previewing their art to their millions of followers. In June, Ciclitira organized a Seoul exhibition called Korean Eye 2020: Creativity and Daydream, featuring the trios artworks, and K-pops pulling power helped it reach a \"much bigger audience,\" the collector said, adding: \"Its bringing people into art.\"For Ohnim, however, the ultimate goal is having his work appreciated by authoritative industry voices. \"I want to really be a true artist,\" he said.Hiding awayWith all the trappings of a K-pop star -- a gigantic ring glinted on his finger as he fielded questions from behind tinted glasses -- Ohnim is not your typical visual artist.Currently pursuing a solo music career while Winner is on hiatus, he initially began drawing as a hobby. The self-taught 28-year-old, who counts the likes of Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele among his favorite artists, eventually became \"more serious\" and transitioned to painting, occasionally posting his art to his 6 million Instagram followers.One of Ohnims paintings, set to be displayed at StART Art Fair.

Among the artworks showcasing at Saatchi is a colorful yet disconcerting series of paintings from his collection \"Hide.\" In one, a haunted face peers out between red and green fingers. In another, the eye of a magenta figures face is being forced open by a disembodied hand.\"Sometimes I need to hide and (have) my own space,\" Ohnim said, when asked about the series.\"Because Im a celebrity, I cant show my emotions. I may be sad sometimes. I may be sick, or I may not feel good about something -- but I need to maintain a certain image. Thats why I called it Hide -- to avoid showing the public the emotions going through me.\"Like artists everywhere, Ohnim has had to literally hide away over the last two years, spending much of his time indoors as Covid-19 swept South Korea. While the pandemic put a pin in his touring schedule, the time alone gave him time to focus on his art, he said.Another painting by Ohnim, depicting a figure surrounded by colorful shapes. Credit: StART Art GlobalWith Ciclitiras help, Ohnim -- along with Yooyeon and Lau -- found a secret studio, away from the prying eyes of their legions of fans. He shared many of his new paintings on social media, completing 20 artworks during the pandemic so far (11 of them will go on display in London).\"I started feeling responsibility and a heavy burden that I need to improve, to be more passionate and dedicate myself as an artist,\" he said.Referencing the so-called \"K-wave\" -- a name for rising interest in South Korean music, movies and TV dramas overseas -- Ohnim believes visual artists will eventually enjoy a similar spotlight. \"A part of me wants to be leading K-culture and to give other people the chance to show their art around the world,\" he said, adding: \"I feel like I have to be one of its leaders to perform well.\"A helping handCiclitira may be known as an art collector, but he has also enjoyed a prolific career in the music industry. As chairman of events and entertainment group Live Company, he has worked with and promoted the likes of Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson and Tina Turner. He has also worked extensively in South Korea, developing close links with Ohnims label, YG Entertainment, which has managed some of the biggest names in K-pop, including Psy of \"Gangnam Style\" fame.While Ohnim was already well-established as a musician, one of Ciclitiras companys directors, Sonia Hong, recognized his wider artistry after one of his paintings went viral on Instagram, racking up over a million likes.\"I said, Oh my god, Mino paints?\" she recalled in a video interview.Herself a music industry veteran, Hong has worked with the StART founder for 14 years and has a close friendship with the managing director of Ohnims label. Sensing the rappers potential, she contacted the label to see more of his art, which she then showed to curators at Saatchi Gallery. (\"We dont recruit people just because theyre famous,\" she said.) After they deemed his work, in Hongs words, \"interesting,\" they moved forward with the collaboration alongside Yeoyeon and Lau.Ciclitira speaks highly of the trios attitude, saying they have \"never once thrown in my face\" the fact that theyre famous.Featured StART Art Fair participant Henry Lau, who creates abstract paintings in black and white.

They genuinely want to ask what you feel about their work.\"Ciclitira is careful to clarify that he and Hong \"dont manage\" any of the stars and are instead \"helping them,\" along with other artists showing at StART. Ohnim maintains his own management, noting that his label has been \"very supportive\" but \"cautious\" about his celebrity being \"abused.\"It remains to be seen if Ohnim will be able to attend his Saatchi debut in London amid scheduling and pandemic restrictions. Ciclitira, who even arranged for the star to be vaccinated in the hope it would improve his chances of visiting the UK, must contend with the stars other commitments: namely a South Korean reality TV show, which begins shooting around the time of the opening.When asked whether hell attend the art fairs opening, Ohnim broke into English for the first time in the interview.

See all coverage here.Paris-based designer Rick Owens has been called many things in his long career. An antihero, a goth, fashions \"prince of darkness.\" Hes been labeled as such because of his proclivity for a largely noir, gray and ice-hued oeuvre, his deployment of pentagram motifs on underwear or elk antlers on furniture, and an overall aesthetic that is -- and hed agree with this -- rapturously anti-establishment.\"I get it, I mean, its easy to categorize somebody.

Im fine with it.\"Michèle Lamy and Rick Owens attend the Gareth Pugh show as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear in 2014. Credit: Michel Dufour/WireImage/Getty ImagesOwens, who is half American and half Mexican (his mother is from Puebla, just a few hours outside of Mexico City), was born and raised in Porterville, California, before launching his namesake line in Los Angeles in 1994. He relocated to Paris in 2003 with his partner Michèle Lamy , and now lives between the French capital and Venice, Italys Lido, where he keeps a penthouse flat that overlooks the sea (and where, during the Covid-19 pandemic, he staged and filmed intimate runway shows; Thursdays Paris catwalk marked his return to the city after a year and a half).His label, which remains majority owned by him and Lamy, is a success story -- to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per year, thanks to his main collection, his diffusion lines, a furniture collection, brand partnerships and more. He has received numerous accolades, including a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and is an industry darling despite remaining, to many, a bit of a dark horse. Hes also become more and more of a celebrity favorite, beloved by stars such as Lil Uzi Vert, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, and Timothée Chalamet , who layered Rick Owens into his recent Met Gala look.People want to imagine that everythings going to be fine, and that weve got it all under control. Rick OwensAbove all, Owens, who turns 60 in November, may be among the most unfiltered designers working today -- its a trait thats rare, especially when many luxury brands fall under heavily patrolled corporate approval processes and safety stops. His honesty is refreshing: \"I like bombast, yet theres been anger all along. I grew up in such a conservative, judgy town, and it filled me with so much rage,\" says Owens. \"Im still operating on that rage. This is my revenge. Im still vengeful. Im still a vengeful Scorpio.\"During Paris Fashion Week in 2019, Owens show at the Palais de Tokyo blended harmoniously with a fortuitous on-site exhibition by sculptor Thomas Houseago. Credit: Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesOwens product is ultra luxurious, but it doesnt stick to the confines of stereotypical and mass-peddled opulence. Blistered leathers, exotic skins, tape-thin cashmere knits, overwashed denim, and a bit of roughened glamour, such as with injections of sequins or foils, have all played a role in defining his singular design vernacular. His shapes and silhouettes are outsized, clingy, languid, and, frankly, captivating. It all congeals to form something futuristic and deeply primal in tandem. Neanderthal to alien, and yet strangely well-suited for the modern era.\"What I always try to do is bring auteurship to my work,\" he says. \"The fact is, all of my life, Ive tried to present something that is an alternative to a very strict aesthetic that we see in this world. We are expected to adhere to it, but I try to blur the lines. And not in a militant way, but in a way thats saying, I propose this as an alternative to the standards you are used to. I think with confidence and a certain amount of flair and boldness, we have established our own kind of beauty. A smarter beauty.\"Owens balanced approach -- that fashion can thrive as a tug-o-war between gloom and joy -- is also reflected in his track record of both controversy and truly brilliant strokes.Step teams from US sororities were hired by Owens in 2013 to model his Spring-Summer 2014 collection. Credit: Catwalking/Getty ImagesRegarding the former, in June, 2015, a model walking in an Owens show held up a sign that read \"Please Kill Angela Merkel Not.\" There was some speculation as to whether it was an inside job, a violent stunt to drum up publicity (Owens denies any prior knowledge of it).With the latter, there are two standouts in particular. One dates to September, 2013, when Owens hired step teams from American sororities instead of traditional models to present his Spring-Summer 2014 collection. The show was a sensation, and, its worth noting, it occurred years before the fashion industrys system-wide push for greater racial diversity and size inclusivity.The new Spring-Summer 2022 Rick Owens collection debuted September 30 at Paris Fashion Week 2021. Credit: Estrop/GettyThe other involves another runway show, this time in 2019. Owens has a history of presenting at the Palais de Tokyo, and the large size of the location regularly demands creative space-filling.That summer, there was an on-site exhibition of work by the artist and sculptor Thomas Houseago. One such piece was installed smack in the middle of Owens set. The designer extrapolated off of the idea, and imported clay from Houseagos Los Angeles studio, mixing it with Parisian mud, and including it as part of the staging. Most importantly, it didnt go to waste: \"Its clay that came from Los Angeles that was in a Rick Owens show that ended up at the Louvre, being used by students in their own creativity,\" says Owens. \"And I just loved that.

Overall, the collection reverberated with confidence and a sort of elegant-yet-menacing energy; it was a charged-up homecoming, of sorts, but Owens doesnt assign too many specific emotions to his work.Plus, as always, he wrestles with the bigger questions: \"[With shows coming back after the pandemic], everybody is going to want to flex. Everyone is going to want to show that they are stronger than ever, that theyre more powerful than ever. Its a little horrifying, but I get it. So thats where my head is right now. Im thinking, nobody wants to see humility. Nobody wants to see a humble lesson. People want to see that were back to full power.\" Then, smiling mischievously, he concludes: \"People want to imagine that everythings going to be fine, and that weve got it all under control.\"Top image: Rick Owens at his Menswear Fall/Winter 2020-2021 show at Paris Fashion Week in 2020.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/rick-owens-paris-fashion-week/index.html"}, {"title": "How non-binary TikTok creators are helping a generation find their style", "data_published": "2021-09-29T09:50:50Z", "content": "Written by Megan Wallace, CNNWhile up-and-coming gender-fluid and non-binary designers like Harris Reed and Ella Boucht have begun to make their mark, its also no secret that the fashion establishment hasnt made much of an effort to design for non-binary people -- at least thats if the collection after collection of drab, supposedly \"gender-fluid\" beige hoodies and graphic tees is to judge by.And while gender non-conforming, trans and non-binary people have existed forever, social media means that they have a new visibility and means of making their voices heard (including sharing memes roasting each subpar unisex capsule collection). However, in the past year or so, TikTok has becomes the grounds for a thriving style community, where non-binary content creators swap gender-affirming fashion tips or simply -- but no less importantly -- freely express their style.\"Fashion is a vehicle for expression,\" said Kate Sabatine, who uses the handle @k8sabz , in an email interview. \"Every day I wake up and ask myself, What gender do I want to express myself as?\"Kate Sabatine (@k8sabz) offers their style tips and queer-focused fashion advice. Credit: CNNSabatine has racked up over 948,000 followers on TikTok with an eclectic mix of videos that includes queer-focused fashion advice (as well as roleplaying a range of hyper-specific lesbian characters), For them, fashion has been an important aspect of having their gender and identity affirmed.\"I think that over the years, Ive gotten quite good at this form of expression,\" they said. \"People tell me, I could tell youre gay by your outfit or will often ask me for my pronouns because they dont want to assume based on my appearance.\"With 6 million views on the #nonbinaryfashion tag and 10.4 millions views on the #unisexfashion tag at the time of publish, there are numerous inspirational outfit-of-the-day posts, advice-based clips with titles like \"outfits with both masc + femme energy,\" and challenges like \"show me your favourite non-binary outfit equation, I will start.\"To the average person, these videos might seem fun but far from revolutionary -- like a queer interpretation of the noughties style blogger heyday -- but for the non-binary community, particularly for people who have recently embraced their identity, theyre vital resources. Given that most mainstream fashion stores still divide clothing into \"menswear\" and \"womenswear,\" and dont provide gender-neutral changing rooms, many non-binary people have to take it upon themselves to experiment with their styles in a non-judgmental environment.Curious about what form this experimentation takes? In one video, user @robinstares mimicks the dress of the queer comedian Chris Fleming, channeling \"Florida grandad vibes,\" while in another, @kyronrizzo appears to levitate through an array of outfit changes. Illustrating a wardrobe hack, creator @maxwellvice transforms two old pairs of fishnets into a sheer strappy top that, as Vice narrates, makes people \"think Im wearing Mugler when I walk down the street.\" For the less crafty among us, videos by the likes of @cgi.vampire offer tongue-in-cheek advice to live by: \"Get down with dressing weird\".A community-led havenAccording to Momo Amjad, senior strategic researcher at trend forecaster The Future Laboratory, a distaste toward the fashion establishment and its norms is partly why non-binary fashion has found such a home on TikTok, especially with a capitalism-sceptic Gen Z audience.\"TikTok (is) creator- and community-led, rather than brand-led, which lends it enormous credibility and authenticity,\" Amjad explained in an email interview. \"Brand-driven resources are often seen as self-serving and therefore not in the interest of the consumer at heart. These consumers are asking, Who made these resources?, Who benefits from them? and What is the motivation behind them?\"This is why Sabatine, one of the apps biggest non-binary fashion creators, says that their fashion videos have the simple goal of encouraging followers to find their own style, without the pressure to achieve an unattainable look established by the fashion elite.\"I hope to teach people, especially my impressionable, younger audience that you dont need to follow trends to look and feel cool and that it doesnt have to be expensive to express yourself,\" they explained.In some of their videos, Sabatine also explores thrifting, tacitly encouraging those watching to consume mindfully. Sustainability is an inextricable key to their work -- they say nearly their entire wardrobe is second-hand, thrifted or vintage. \"I wanted to help people express themselves and do so sustainably,\" they explained. \"Some of the outfits I wear in my videos cost me less than 20 dollars from head to toe, but you would never know it.\"Brands need to do a whole lot moreLike Sabatine, artist, stylist and art director Darkwah Kyei-Darkwah ( @hausofdarkwah ) is also active on TikToks #nonbinaryfashion tag. But while on Instagram, they post text slides about non-binary identity and micraggressions such as misgendering, their TikTok feed is an unadulterated celebration of non-binary finery: experimental beauty looks, clips of them sewing their own outfits, and the occasional photoshoot BTS moment.\"Where I am now with my fashion and sense of style is that it really is a complete culmination of how I feel,\" they said in an audio interview. So I think it just spills out on TikTok however Im feeling at whatever given day, at whatever given time.\"Darkwah Kyei-Darkwah, a stylist and art director, says \"brands need to do a whole lot more\" to make clothing more inclusive. Credit: CNNFor someone already in the fashion industry like Kyei-Darkwah, theres one main different between how non-binary people dress in real life and what major brands seem to think of them.\"Non-binary people actually have style,\" Kyei-Darkwah said.While the artist is not rushing out to buy gender-neutral capsule collections that make wearers look, as they put it, \"like an amoeba floating through the city in an oversized t-shirt and oversized track pants,\" theyre also put off by the sizing constraints of mainstream womenswear.\"Brands need to do a whole lot more. What about skirts that, rather than a zip at the side, have three buckles that you can fasten at different widths so that the body freely flows through different sizes?\" they offered. \"I may be a size eight in \"womenswear\" but my butt may not fit into a size eight the way that a size eight is made.\"For the time-being, TikTok has a solution for that, too, if youre willing to search it out: the #sewingtiktok community, a space where individuals can gain information on making and altering their own clothes rather than squeezing themselves into outfits created by binary gender divisions.While the #nonbinaryfashion community is yet to spark major industry overhauls, that might not be a bad thing: gender-diverse LGBTQIA+ youth are, out of necessity, retooling to start their own fashion revolution. Through positive representation, styling tips and sustainable fashion recommendations, they are forming part of a wider online community providing much-needed support to those who are trying to navigate a cissexist world.For Amjad, this queer generations capacity to create spaces to thrive online is one of Gen Zs strengths.\"Social media in general, and not just TikTok, (is) having an education and learning-focused revolution driven by young people who feel that mainstream discourse does not serve to enlighten them or liberate them,\" Amjad said.Top image: Left to right, TikTok creators @hausofdarkwah, @maxwellvice, @kyronrizzo, @k8sabz.

No film in the 007 franchise has had quite the wait, nor lived under the weight of expectation, like \"No Time To Die.\" A change of director, nearly half a dozen release dates, a studio sale and a global pandemic couldnt defeat the British spy, but hes never been challenged like this before. Six tumultuous years after the last movie, the final chapter of the Daniel Craig era has arrived.At times it felt like we might not have had this film at all. Craig, in a quote that went far and wide on the tour for \"Spectre\" in 2015, said hed rather \" slash my wrists \" than do another Bond, and his return wasnt confirmed until 2017 . By March 2018 , British director Danny Boyle was working on a screenplay, then in the summer things began to unravel as \" creative differences \" emerged.\"One day Danny left, and for God knows all sorts of very good reasons,\" recalled Veronique Melery, the films set decorator. \"We found ourselves a bit, I mean, more than lost, waiting for a new director to come in.\"A month after Boyles departure in August, Cary Joji Fukunaga of \"True Detective\" and \"Beasts of No Nation\" fame was announced as his replacement. He wrote a new story alongside series stalwarts Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, and the shoot began in early 2019. \"It was a completely new job,\" Melery said. \"What we did before Cary entered was not relevant anymore.\"Daniel Craig as James Bond in \"No Time to Die.\" Credit: MGM/UniversalSeries gatekeepers, producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, say each script begins with two questions: 1. What is the world going to be afraid of in two or three years when the film comes out? And 2. What are the emotional and personal challenges Bond will face?\"The combination of those two things means that we do something fresh each time,\" said Broccoli. \"Of course, now it turned out to be four years hence because of Covid,\" added Wilson. \"You have to get out your crystal ball and take a stab at it. In this particular case, I think we came pretty close to what the world is concerned about.\"Yes, there is a large irony at the heart of \"No Time To Die\" that audiences will have to discover for themselves. Without divulging too much, after the prologue we meet up with Bond five years after leaving MI6. But his retirement in a Jamaican idyll is short-lived when an old friend enlists his help after a scientist goes missing.Daniel Craig and writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga talk on set.

Its also a film advertized as the actors final appearance. Bond may be an immortal character, but \"No Time To Die\" represents an ending.Fukunaga notes that stories with long dramatic arcs often conclude disappointingly and was determined to avoid this fate. To do so he returned to the beginning.\"I used Casino (Royale) as his first film as an inspiration of sorts -- thats where all these larger arcs are jumping from,\" he told CNN. \"How do we conclude those? Which characters do we bring back? What are the scenarios that were presented over the course of the films that shaped and changed him? And how can these themes be brought back in and see where that leaves us now as a sort of final goodbye?\"There was also the question of tone. This is the first Bond post-#MeToo -- an asteroid if ever there was one for the spy M once called a \" sexist, misogynistic dinosaur .\" The director said that \"the more outdated parts of the character were probably weeded out before I came along.\" Nevertheless, Phoebe Waller-Bridge (\"Fleabag,\" \"Killing Eve\") was brought in to work on the script, and according to Broccoli, inject some British humor.James Bond (Daniel Craig) and Paloma (Ana de Armas) in \"No Time To Die.\" Credit: Nicola Dove/DANJAQ, LLC AND MGM. ALL RIGHTS RESERVEDWhile \"No Time To Die\" follows the age-old structure of three supporting female characters, its also keen to set fire to the \" rules \" circumscribing them. Lashana Lynchs Nomi has taken over the 007 moniker in Bonds retirement, Ana de Armas steals the show in her all too brief appearance as newly-minted CIA agent Paloma, and Lea Seydoux returns as Madeleine Swann in an arc not seen in the films before.\"I think this movie is Bond women, not so much Bond girls,\" argued de Armas. \"Theyre highly skilled, theyre powerful (and) they all show it in their own way. Theyre equals to Bond ... Times change, and I think that is reflected in the film.\"But for every progressive element, this is a series grounded in tradition. Location manager Charlie Hayes came on board during what he diplomatically calls the \"period of restart.\" \"The script was still in flux,\" he recalled, and he, Fukunaga and production designer Mark Tildesley kicked around where Bond might go next. Alongside new locations (the Faroe Islands) there are places more familiar, like Jamaica, long considered the spiritual home of Bond by virtue of his creator Ian Fleming having a villa there.Matera, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in southern Italy, pictured in a scene in \"No Time To Die.\" Credit: MGM/UniversalMelery decorated Bonds Jamaican home. Its a rare opportunity; while the books describe the spys Chelsea apartment, the films have only visited his house on three occasions. \"Bond is this character who travels, who doesnt carry his past with him, doesnt really settle easily,\" she said. Thats all changed. \"I hope that even if its really short moments, we understand a bit of this person when we see where he lives.\"\"Nothing is gratuitous,\" Melery said of her work. \"Its a direct connection with himself,\" she added, explaining the movie shows \"a certain kind of failure\" and \"emotional weakness\" from the MI6 chief \"which we are not used to.\" The setting is indicative of a pivot to sharing more of the characters private lives. In \"No Time To Die\" we visit Qs apartment (complete with a work from home set up many would kill for), and Melery and Tildesley injected more personality into Ms office. A Paul Nash painting \" Battle of Germany \", an abstract work from 1944 of a city under attack, was selected to hang on his wall and features prominently. Nash aficionados will discover the painting speaks to multiple themes within the film.\"Nothing is gratuitous,\" Melery said of her work. \"Its a direct connection with himself,\" she added, explaining the movie shows \"a certain kind of failure\" and \"emotional weakness\" from the MI6 chief \"which we are not used to.\"find Elsewhere, there are callbacks to the work of the franchises first production designer, Ken Adam. For the lair belonging to villain Safin (Rami Malek), Tildesley and Fukunaga wanted to return to the Brutalist movement that influenced Adam (look hard enough and you canfind a direct reference to \"Dr. No\" ). Full of bare concrete and sharp angels, its the kind of set few blockbusters pull off these days.With Paul Nashs \"Battle of Germany\" to their backs, M (Ralph Fiennes), Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Tanner (Rory Kinnear) inside Ms office.

Hayes worked with all three branches of the British military, and a C-17 RAF warplane and a Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer both have supporting roles. A car chase through Matera in southern Italy meant commandeering the main road running up and down the hilltop town and UNESCO World Heritage Site. For an early scene involving figures in military garb abseiling down a London skyscraper, a team hung cameras from buildings in Canary Wharf and stitched the shot together with actors on a studio set. The name Bond \"definitely gets you through the door,\" Hayes said. \"They know youre professional, they know that theyre in good hands.\"Characters abseiling down a skyscraper in a scene in \"No Time To Die.\" Credit: MGM/UniversalIts the scale of the film -- as well as the occasion -- that its creators hope will entice audiences back into cinemas after three release dates (April 2020, November 2020 and April 2021) were nixed due to the pandemic.\"We literally shot on IMAX,\" said Fukunaga. \"Just being around an audience and feeling the laughs and the tension and that sort of collective, contagious energy of being in an audience ... I think the film plays very well to all those things.\"Even the actor behind Q believes its time for audiences to put the gadgets away. \"This one has an incredible scale and spectacle and visual imagination,\" Ben Whishaw said. \"It would be really so disappointing if people were watching it at home or, even worse, on their phones on YouTube.\"Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) and James Bond in \"No Time To Die.\" Credit: DANJAQ, LLC AND MGM. ALL RIGHTS RESERVEDFor now, the limelight is firmly on Craig, an actor who has overhauled the spy and seems to finally be at peace with the franchise just as he makes for the exit.\"He (Craig) brought a modernity to the character that we havent seen in previous iterations,\" said Fukunaga. \"He showed us a very complicated man, with damage and with a heart -- a beating heart -- as well as being an effective killer.\" How will he be remembered? \"I think very fondly.\"\"With his portrayal weve really been able to explore the emotional life of Bond. Weve seen him cry in films. Weve seen him bleed,\" said Broccoli. \"Weve seen him be very vulnerable. And I think thats one of the trademarks of his extraordinary reign.\"And now its all over. The film is soon to be with audiences and Broccoli, Wilson and co. will be back staring into their crystal ball.

Hills, CNNWhen Lorraine West told her mother about a new exhibition celebrating the work of Black jewelers, she burst into tears over the phone.West, a jeweler for more than 20 years, said she doesnt normally \"get emotional\" when it comes to her professional achievements, which include seeing celebrities like Beyoncé and Zendaya wearing her designs. But her inclusion in the groundbreaking show \"made me cry,\" she recalled.\"I wasnt expecting it,\" she said over email. \"I allowed myself to feel it and release the tears of joy and gratitude.\"Known for elegant gold statement pieces that favor sophisticated settings over large stones, West said she was inspired to start designing after playing with her mothers jewelry as a child. Now, she is one of 21 Black jewelers showcasing and selling their work at \" Brilliant & Black: A Jewelry Renaissance .\"The exhibitions curator, writer and jewelry expert Melanie Grant, said she believes this is the first time a major auction house has spotlighted \"pioneering Black jewelry design.\"Open this week at Sothebys New York, the show features not only contemporary designers but overlooked African American jewelers dating back to the 1950s. Works by Winifred Mason, believed to be the first ever commercial African American jeweler in the United States, are showcased alongside those of her later apprentice Art Smith, a mid-century designer known for his modernist bronze works.A necklace and belt design, by jeweler Winifred Mason Chenet, crafted from brass and copper. The piece is stamped with her signature \"Chenet\" and the word \"Haiti.\"Calling him a \"founding father\" of Black jewelry design, Grant said Smiths brilliance went unappreciated at the time. \"It was quite important for me to put a couple (of historic jewelers) in context (with) the modern designers. Without them, we would be in a different place.\"Honoring heritageAncestry and family ties run deep through the exhibition, with jeweler Johnel Jamison also attributing his start in the industry to his mother. The rapper turned jewelry designer wanted to bring a sense of \"kingmanship\" to his stage performances, so, before he set off for a European tour, his mother helped him create a wire wrap ring using a large black tourmaline stone that had once sat on their family mantelpiece.Jeweler Johnel Jamison wearing pieces from his brand Johnny Nelson.

Sometimes being Black is enough.\"While the sale focuses on successful high-end designers, Grant acknowledges that up-and-coming Black creatives face disadvantage and discrimination in the jewelry business. Reaching the industrys upper echelons can be \"so expensive,\" she said, adding that getting \"the big stones\" requires \"connections.\"A 2020 study commissioned by Jewelers of America and National Jeweler magazine found that only 8.2% of US jewelry industry employees -- and just 2.8% of employers -- were Black or African American. That same year, a UK survey, by jeweler Kassandra Lauren Gordon and craft organization the Goldsmiths Company, found that over half of Black British jewelers had experienced racism in the industry.Rihanna pictured at the 2021 Met Gala wearing the Rebel Black Ring a piece designed by Thelma West, one of the 21 jewelers featured in the new Sothebys exhibition.

Unlike White and Asian jewelers, \"we dont own fashion houses and we dont have generations of manufacturers in our family,\" he said, adding: \"We have to do (what we can) to build the generational wealth within this industry.\"To overcome this, Black jewelers often share resources with one another, Jamison said, citing fellow creatives like Maggi Simpkins and Mateo New York founder Matthew Harris. \"These are all people that had to work a little (harder) to get the same resources that their White counterparts have.\"But the fact remains, he added, that not many young Black creatives see jewelry design as a viable career option: \"Thats not really in our scope. Were taught to be the consumers and not the producers.\"A brass sculptural necklace by mid-century jeweler Art Smith, set to be displayed at Sothebys \"Brilliant and Black: A Jewelry Renaissance\" selling exhibition.A number of initiatives have been launched in recent years to help young Black designers get their start in the jewelry industry. The Art Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund , named in honor of the aforementioned pioneer, sees 50 jewelry brands supporting scholarships at the Fashion Institute of Technology and industry mentorships. The recent resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement also led to increased attention on Black jewelers, Jamison said, though that visibility does not necessarily translate into commercial gains.\"Dont just wait until theres a big Black Lives Matter movement,\" he said, adding that he hopes \"compassion for Black lives wasnt temporary.\"\"Now were going to just talk about all the Black jewelers, but then not use any of the resources you have to actually get us into stores so we could create consistent income.\"West echoed the sentiment with her message to luxury buyers and the jewelry business at large: \"Highlight us in the most equitable ways possible.

Best known for transforming a series of aviation fuel tanks into a popular riverside gallery in Shanghai, the pairs understated theaters and performance spaces offer a welcome dose of subtlety in a country with skylines all too often blighted by bold statements.\"Its about making a dialogue between us, as humanity, and nature,\" Li said in a video interview.Chapel of Sound, a concert hall built in a valley northeast of Beijing. Credit: Courtesy Ni Nan/OPENThe couples latest project is a case in point. Nestled in a valley northeast of Beijing, a stones throw from the Great Wall, the boulder-like Chapel of Sound looks as if it were carved from the landscape itself. The architects added local rocks to the concrete and mimicked sedimentary layers to help assimilate the structure with its surroundings.Although envisaged as a place for quiet contemplation -- or \"a chapel without religion,\" as Li put it -- the building is primarily a concert hall. Instead of traditional soundproofing, Li and Huang opted for strategically placed holes that, they claim, play the same role as absorbent surfaces.The openings also serve two very different functions: Producing plays of light and shadow that travel across the cavernous interior as the sun moves through the sky; and letting in the sounds of breeze, birds and insects. While this may seem counterintuitive for a quiet concert space, the architects were never interested in creating \"a perfect silence.\"Another view of the Chapel of Sound. Credit: Courtesy Jonathan Leijonhu/OPEN\"Were really trying to make a deeper connection to the ancient natural history of the site,\" Li said. \"Theres a mysterious quality of space, and mysteriousness is something were very interested in: bringing people to discover a different kind of experience.\"More than landmarksOver 150 miles to Beijings east, in the seaside city of Qinhuangdao, an equally mysterious art museum offers a different take on Open Architectures manifesto pledge of \"striking a new balance between the man-made and nature.\"UCCA Dune, a new outpost for one of Beijings most respected contemporary art institutions, takes the appearance of pebbles strewn across a sandy beach. The primordial, cave-like gallery spaces are not only integrated with their surroundings -- they are partially submerged by them.The photogenic design has helped make Qinhuangdao an unlikely destination for design-lovers and day-trippers from the Chinese capital. And while Li and Huang seem unshowy by nature, they are acutely aware of the power of iconic architecture.UCCA Dune, an art museum in the coastal city of Qinhuangdao. Credit: Courtesy Zaiye Studio/OPENIn China, its a power that has been abused in recent years -- by property giants branding real estate developments with outlandish skyscrapers, and by local officials using big-budget cultural buildings to put their cities on the map. But, citing Sydney Opera House as an example, Li believes that well-designed arts venues can give cities a distinct identity while also contributing to their cultural fabric.What Open Architecture is opposed to, he said, are landmarks for landmarks sake. This stance can put the pair at odds with their clients, like when officials from Yantai, in Shandong province, approached them with an invitation to \"create an iconic landmark.\"\"That was the only brief: Make a landmark,\" Li recalled. \"They came to us and said, We want something like the Vessel in New Yorks Hudson Yards. And I said that was exactly what we dont want to do.\"Rather than walking away, Li said he convinced the citys government to develop a more meaningful cultural program. Eventually satisfied that their creation would serve a purpose, the architecture duo designed a sundial-inspired structure -- dubbed The Sun Tower and set for completion in 2023 -- that incorporates a library, digital museum and outdoor theater.\"I think its a huge waste of resources to build something without knowing what it is,\" Li said.A digital rendering of the Sun Tower in Yantai, Shandong province. Credit: Courtesy OPENThe idea that architects should only create buildings that are needed seems simple enough. But it is one often ignored in China. With the countrys government now pumping billions of dollars a year into the cultural sector, supply can outstrip demand, leading to unused vanity projects and \"ghost\" museums . When it comes to culture, the \"build and they will come\" model that has accommodated Chinas breakneck rural-urban migration, may not apply, Huang said.\"There is a huge push for cultural buildings,\" she said. \"(In China, we) feel as if we have developed really fast, but left ourselves behind and need to catch up to show the world we have culture. But its hard to cultivate culture and... much faster to build. So thats why you see a lot of cultural buildings pop up with no contents and nobody to operate them.\"Such accusations could not be leveled against Open Architectures Tank Shanghai, a gallery that breathed new life into the site of a decommissioned airport by the Huangpu River. Built into five renovated fuel tanks, the venue offers not only gallery spaces but also a pub, a restaurant and performance facilities. Landscaped parks meanwhile dissolve the distinction between public and private space, high culture and recreation.Tank Shanghai was built in a series of disused aviation fuel tanks. Credit: Courtesy Tian Fangfang/OPENOffering community parkland was not simply a gesture to the city -- it expressed the idea that art should not stand apart from everyday life.\"The purpose of a cultural buildings is to try and enlighten people, but nowadays theyre becoming more and more like isolated objects,\" Li said. \"Art is put up (on a pedestal). We want to bring it closer to the ground -- to the people -- and blur the boundaries.\"Universal valuesThat homegrown designers like Li and Huang are being entrusted with a new generation of Chinese venues should come as little surprise. But the cultural landscape has long been shaped by foreign forces. From Zaha Hadids sculptural Guangzhou Opera House to a Norman Fosters long-awaited museum in far-flung Datong , Western names are frequently asked to oversee Chinas biggest contemporary landmarks -- not only for their technical prowess and avant-garde designs but, often, for the prestige.The trend traces back to the early 2000s and Beijings National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), a huge, shining oval known locally as \"The Giant Egg.\" Just a few blocks from the historic Forbidden City, French architect Paul Andreus controversially futuristic building sparked a wave of Western-designed landmarks and, in Lis words, \"began the whole exercise\" of constructing \"iconic buildings\" in China.It is also a venue that directly shaped Open Architectures approach. Visiting once for a concert, Li found himself on a long quest for water during the intermission, eventually finding just one spot \"in the whole gigantic place\" to get a drink. A small gripe, admittedly, but one he felt spoke to a lack of user-centric design.By way of comparison, Li then recounted a recent visit to Germanys \"fantastic\" Berliner Philharmonie concert hall: \"The break was half an hour, and it was like a party. It was a great social event. That is the true purpose of a cultural building: bringing people together, not just listening to music while you cant even get a water.\"This is not to suggest that Opens founders are somehow opposed to Western design in China. After all, Li made his name under Steven Holl, one of the most prolific foreign architects operating in the country, while Huang once worked for the late I.M. Pei in New York.

IKEA was founded in 1943, with its first flat-pack furniture catalog released just a few years later. By 1954, Time magazine had dedicated its August cover story to the phenomenon, declaring DIY \"the new billion-dollar hobby.\"Color dominated the decade. Gaudy, primary hues were all the rage, but traditional linseed oil paints failed to deliver the desired vibrancy. As a result, the paint industry began moving towards materials made from petroleum and acrylic resins, which were inexpensive to manufacture and encapsulated the bold, post-war optimism that had infiltrated interior design.Farrow & Ball, however, steered clear of acrylics, sticking instead to simple linseed oil, which was purified and mixed with powdered pigment. In acrylic paints, solvents are added to ensure the finish is fast-drying and more durable, but at the price of toxic chemicals. Farrow & Balls method was solvent-free, and remained unchanged until 2009, when the company switched to a water-based recipe.Farrow & Balls \"Preference Red.\" Credit: Courtesy of Farrow & Ball\"They pioneered the chalky matte look for walls and a soft eggshell look on woodwork (that) is less plastic-looking and shiny than modern paints,\" said Victoria Wormsley, an interior designer and owner of London-based French-Brook Interiors, in an email interview.But it wasnt until the 1990s that Farrow & Ball achieved the commercial success it enjoys today. The Dorset paint firm got its big break in 1992 when Tom Helme, an interiors advisor to the National Trust -- a not-for-profit organization that conserves historic buildings and beauty spots across Britain -- took control of Farrow & Ball with corporate financier Martin Ephson.Farrow & Ball began working on cultural heritage projects, providing the National Trust with colors that were \"sympathetic\" to period decor rather than historically accurate. From grandiose stately homes to picturesque cottages, premium estates up and down the UK were restored to their former glory with a fresh lick of carefully curated Farrow & Ball paint. Once the perfect hue had been created for a property, it was canned and sold as part of the brands Heritage range. \"Picture Gallery Red,\" for instance, was first developed to redecorate the picture gallery at Attingham Park in Shropshire, England.\"Farrow & Ball are seen as the original designer paint,\" Wormsley said. \"They were one of the first companies in the UK to market paint as an aspirational product by connecting it to Britains wonderful architectural heritage.\"A 1980s magazine advert for Welsh period interior brand Laura Ashley. Credit: AlamyFlorid decor had dominated the 1980s, and fanfare for fuss and frills continued well into the 1990s. Busy damask wallpaper, elaborate chintz upholstery and gilded baroque styling regularly fronted the covers of magazines like Architectural Digest and World of Interiors -- the more antiquated-looking the better. It was the ideal consumer landscape for a brand like Farrow & Ball, which built its image around the opulent iconography of British stately homes.Amid growing pressure to embrace advanced manufacturing technology -- Australian paint maker Duluxs production, for instance, has been fully automated since 2017 -- Farrow & Balls factory operation still relies on human involvement at every step. Pigments are hand-poured, then each batch is swatched and meticulously inspected by a Farrow & Ball chemist. This craftsmanship may partly account for the brands designer status -- and explain its extravagant price tags.The paint was positioned as luxury by association: If it was good enough for the lovingly maintained mansions of yesteryear, it was good enough for everyone (providing, of course, that you could foot the bill).Farrow & Balls \"Jitney,\" pictured here, was named after a bus from New York to the Hamptons.

The prestigious paint manufacturer even found itself on an infamous tongue-in-cheek list, created by high-society interior designer Nicky Haslam, detailing the worlds most unbearably \"common\" ( a snobbish British term for something that is unrefined or unsophisticated) things. Haslam confidently, if not arbitrarily, placed Farrow & Ball among entries including self-pity, ATMs, swans and hedge funds.Nonetheless, Farrow & Ball has a loyal customer base. One of the Facebook groups dedicated to the paint brand boasts 55,000 members and is used to share application tips, color advice and proud photos of users own handiwork.The peculiar shade names help foster a sense of community, said Wormsley, helping to create a sense of being in-the-know. \"I think (the eccentric color names) gives Farrow & Ball customers a sense of being cognoscenti,\" she added, \"as the colours cant be picked from the names.\"\"Calke Green,\" pictured here, was an original color created to restore Calke Abbey in Derbyshire, England.

Take \"Sulking Room Pink,\" a dusty rose color intended to evoke the sultry glamour of European bedrooms. \"When we made it everyone was like, why is it called that?\" Studholme said. \"And its such a simple reason.\"\"Sulking Room Pink\" was inspired by the French \"boudoir,\" which literally translates \"to sulk.\"\"It was so intriguing,\" Studholme said, \"And it builds affection. I think thats the main thing.\"The quirky names are talking points, too, said Studholme. Colors such as \"Slipper Satin\" or \"Stiffkey Blue\" (be warned: the correct pronunciation is \"stook-y blue\") are memorable precisely for their tricky pronunciation. \"Although I dont think we would deliberately go out and find a difficult word.\"While other period-inspired British brands have fallen by the wayside -- last year, heritage textile and furniture label Laura Ashley was forced to close all 155 UK stores amid declining sales -- Farrow & Ball has consistently managed to capture the aspirational imagination of the middle classes.Rachel Spelling began customizing the Farrow & Ball color chart during the UK lockdown.

Spellings customized version of the Farrow & Ball brochure retails for £150 ($207).But as well as capitalizing on its cultural cachet the brand is also developing a sense of humor to offset its reputation as the markets poshest paint. The seemingly self-aware Farrow & Ball now embraces jokes made at its expense, as demonstrated in the companys first ever TV commercials, first aired in 2020, in which neurotic decorators go to extreme lengths to protect their expensive and delicate paint work.In response to the Saturday Night Live sketch, the paint manufacturers took out an ad in the New York Times unveiling a special edition col-ouuuur, \"English Roast No.30.\"\"A rich and good hum-oured hue with subtle hints of bone-dry satire and a lingering aftertaste of charred British beef,\" read the description. \"Its not just paint, its Farrow & Ball.\"Top image: A kitchen painted in the Farrow & Ball shade \"Bancha,\" named after Japanese tea leaves.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/farrow-and-ball-brand-history/index.html"}, {"title": "'The Mad Women's Ball' explores a dark era of medical history", "data_published": "2021-09-17T21:36:33Z", "content": "Written by Marianna Cerini, CNNKeeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.Its a tale as old as time: A woman wont conform to societal norms, traditional notions of femininity or whats expected of her, and is dismissed as diseased. Shes considered hysterical. And, as such, she is locked up, burned at the stake, hidden away or placed under the supposedly steadier control of men.Its played out in real life, as well as in countless books, TV shows and movies. The French Amazon original feature \"The Mad Womens Ball,\" which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and is out on Amazon Prime today, is the latest addition to the canon.Directed and scripted by Melanie Laurent, and based on Victoria Mas novel of the same name, the richly cinematic costume drama follows the story of Eugénie Cléry (Lou de Laâge), a well-heeled French girl living in Belle Époque Paris in 1885. Eugénie is smart, an avid reader and a rebellious character with an interest in spiritualism. She also sees dead people.Lou de Laâge portrays Eugénie, whose family places her in a sinister neuro-psychiatric clinic against her will. Credit: Christine Tamalet/Thibault Grabherr/Amazon OriginalsHer disregard for convention proves too much for her family. Against Eugénies will, and to the heartbreak of her doting brother (Benjamin Voisin), her father François (Cédric Kahn) commits her to a sinister neuro-psychiatric clinic, the infamous -- and real-life -- Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. It is an institution where women deemed unfit for public life would be \"hospitalized\" and subjected to clinical surveillance and experimental treatments led by celebrated neurology pioneer Dr. Charcot (Grégoire Bonnet).Here, Eugénie finds herself among other \"mad\" women, many of whom have been driven to depressive or psychotic states by the same men who claim to be looking after them.Theres Louise (Lomane de Dietrich), who was sent to the asylum after speaking up about her sexually abusive uncle, only to be harassed by one of the doctors; Marguerite (Lauréna Thellier), a former pickpocket and sex worker who \"suffers\" from outbursts of rage; and Therese, an older woman who was brought to the hospital for pushing her husband into the Seine River.Whether mentally ill or simply victims of trauma, abuse or exploitation, the patients are treated like objects to be prodded and studied, spotlighting the misogyny of early neuroscience and medicine at large. (While the concept of \"hysteria\" emerged in the medieval period, it became prominent in European medicine and culture in the 19th century.)One of the movies most overt displays of this dehumanization -- the \"Mad Womens Ball\" -- is based on an actual event where, for one night only, the upper echelons of French society were invited to gawk at the clinics residents dressed up in their finery.As shes put under the care of the sanatoriums head nurse Geneviève (played by director Laurent herself), Eugénie struggles to adapt to life at Salpêtrière. She is adamant she doesnt belong in the institution -- although she slowly comes to question what -- and who -- exactly, is mad: her fellow prisoners inside, or those outside, exerting control and showing no empathy?The film is an uncomfortable reminder of how society has long demonized the \"hysterical woman.\" Credit: Christine Tamalet/Thibault Grabherr/Amazon OriginalsWhen the spirit of a nurses dead sister begins communicating with Eugénie, Geneviève, too, starts wondering where madness lies and whether a world beyond the tangible might be possible after all.For Laurent, Eugénies story -- and that of the women she befriends -- felt like a timeless one. \"I wanted to make a movie about witches in the Middle Ages, as I have always been fascinated by that part of history,\" she said in a video interview. \"Then my producer sent me the Mad Womens Ball book, and I thought it was incredibly powerful. It was horrifying to see that, 300 years on, women who dared to be different and who could have made society more interesting were still made silent.\"The way Laurent portrays this imposed silence is one of the most compelling aspects of the movie. Scenes focusing on the female patients experience of the patriarchal institution and its dystopian system of oppression are among the productions sharpest and most enraging -- and an uncomfortable reminder of how our culture has long demonized the \"hysterical woman.\"But \"The Mad Womens Ball\" also triggers a different kind of ethical negotiation for the viewer. For all her quick-wittedness, Eugénies ability to speak with the dead is hard to understand for anyone who values science over faith. On paper, shes not \"well,\" yet calling her insane doesnt seem fitting either. This duality makes her character -- and the movie -- all the more challenging, as were asked to grapple with the rational and the irrational, the acceptable and the otherworldly.\"Eugénie is delicate and fragile, but shes also very strong,\" Laurent said. \"She goes against the crowd because she is against the crowd. I wanted to emphasize that.\"As Geneviève starts rejecting the rules of Salpêtrière and decides to help Eugénie, the emotional connection between the two women ultimately frees them both from some of the constraints -- societal and cultural -- theyve struggled against, helping them find their self-worth in a male-centeric world.Add to Queue: Female hysteria in focusIts the same setting -- the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital -- but a different take on Dr. Charcot and his experimental methods to \"cure\" women. Alice Winocours movie \"Augustine\" is based on the true story of a 19-year-old maid prone to inexplicable displays of \"hysteria\" (very possibly epileptic fits) who became one of the neurologists most renowned patients. After a seizure leaves her paralyzed on one side, Augustine is shipped off to the all-female psychiatric clinic, where Charcot begins using her as his principal subject, hypnotizing her in front of an enthralled audience of male physicians to demonstrate his theories on madness and neurosis. As Charcot and Augustines relationship continues, the boundary between doctor and patient starts to blur.Lisa Appignanesis ambitious, richly researched book explores the history of studying the female mind, investigating why women through the years have been categorized as \"mad,\" \"bad\" and \"sad\" far more often than men. Mixing evocative case studies -- including Zelda Fitzgerald, Marilyn Monroe and Virginia Woolf -- with medical theories by Freud, Lacan and \"feminine psychology\" pioneer Karen Horney, its a great dive into the complex history of mental illness.Darren Aronfonskys story of madness isnt set in an asylum, but the way it addresses desire, mental illness and personal demons -- whether imagined or real -- offers a contemporary take on the \"hystericized\" woman. Nina Sayers is a professional dancer who gets tapped by her troupes manipulative director to play the Swan Queen. The role consists of two personas: the sweet, virginal White Swan awaiting her prince, and the sexually provocative Black Swan, who lures the prince away. But the dichotomy proves too much for the already troubled ballerina, who soon starts having terrifying visions of her bodys metamorphosis into a swan.A former US factory town called LeRoy, between Rochester and Buffalo in New York state, made headlines in 2012 when 14 girls and one boy were afflicted with undiagnosed verbal and physical tics, in what was described as an episode of mass hysteria.

A final selection of 2021s 10 \"ugliest\" buildings will be announced at the end of the year, with public polling accounting for 40% of the final decision, according to organizers.Poll \"winners\" in recent years have included a cultural center shaped like a crab and a pedestrian bridge embellished with a series of six oversized \"diamonds.\"There is clearly no shortage of questionable designs in a country that has rapidly urbanized and now builds more skyscrapers than the rest of the world combined.

Credit: TPG/Getty ImagesPresident Xi has long voiced his concern about Chinas reputation for odd architecture. In 2014, he openly criticized the construction of unusual buildings at a Beijing literary symposium, according to state media reports, and his government has since sought to regulate the countrys skylines.In June 2020, Chinas housing ministry and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a powerful economic planning body, issued a circular calling for an end to \"copycat\" buildings and skyscrapers taller than 500 meters (1,640 feet). The NDRC reiterated the height restriction earlier this year, with a policy document that also \"strictly prohibits\" the construction of \"ugly\" buildings, in favor of those that are \"suitable, economical, green and beautiful.\"The ban on 500-meter-plus buildings will, in practice, affect very few of the countrys architects: there are only five skyscrapers of that height in the country, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats . But the new government communiqués have included a slew of less eye-catching -- but potentially far-reaching -- proposals.Suggestions have included appointing a chief architect for each city, as seen in many Western countries, as well as a credit system that could blacklist designers who do not comply with planning regulations. The government has also warned against demolishing historical buildings, while encouraging designs that \"highlight Chinese characteristics.\" For example, the American architects behind Beijings tallest skyscraper, China Zun, told CNN in 2019 they had been forced to modify their design mid-construction after the vice mayors office suggested it \"wasnt Chinese enough.\"The Xiangyang Science and Technology Museum, one of several museums named in the annual Ugliest Building Survey.

According to Fei Chen, a senior architecture professor specializing in urban policy at the UKs Liverpool University, new guidelines provide a broad framework for cities, but finer details must be resolved at a local level.\"Architects and urban designers may benefit from quite specific guidance on what good design is,\" she said at the time of the housing ministry circular. \"But this needs to be related to the local context, so I wouldnt expect the national government to produce guidance like this. What works in one context may not work in another.\"There is also, she added, huge variation in architectural standards around the country.\"In east-coast cities, or more developed areas, architects have better design skills, so they produce better buildings.

But last week, the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, Germany, where shes been housed for most of her long life, has finally unveiled an amorous secret, hidden long ago beneath layers of paint.Ahead of its upcoming show about the celebrated Dutch painter, the museum has released an image of a drastically changed \"Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window,\" which the Dutch artist painted between 1657 and 1659. Following a painstaking four-year-long restoration, the empty wall now shows a monumental painting of Cupid, discovered by X-ray in 1979, but now revealed for the first time.The unveiling of Cupid, the Roman god of love who is often represented as a winged boy, gives the girls letter new connotations of affection, longing and desire. The painting will go on view at the Gemäldegalerie from September 10 along with nine of Vermeers other major works and 50 paintings by his Dutch peers.When the hidden Cupid was first found over four decades ago, it was believed the Delft-born artist had himself painted over it. X-rays of other famous artworks have often revealed early drafts, and Vermeer was known to rework his compositions, believing that the harmony of his paintings reflected the harmony of God, according to Stephan Koja, art historian and director of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister.\"It was common sense to think that Vermeer had overpainted this part of his composition because he had done this several times,\" Koja said in a video interview. \"He really was a perfectionist trying to get the most calibrated and most convincing composition.\"The restoration process was painstakingly slow. Conservators meticulously removed a section of overpaint over the course of two and a half years. Credit: Gemäldegalerie Alte MeisterBut when conservators began cleaning the painting in 2017, they found evidence suggesting otherwise. Varnish on the stretch of empty wall behind the young girl was a different color, and the consistency of the paint was different too, Koja said. When researchers investigated samples in an archaeometry laboratory, they found dirt hiding in between layers of paint, signaling that someone else had added the overpaint much later.\"We realized that the dirt meant that the painting was finished; it was exposed to the light and to the circumstances of a room for several decades,\" Koja said. Now, the team involved believe it was painted over sometime in the early 18th century. But as to who did it, they can only guess.Not the only mysteryThe hidden Cupid is far from the only mystery of the Baroque artists life. The painter, like the enigmatic Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci, had a preciously small output, with only around 34 canvases thought to have survived to today. Hes best known for his delicate interior scenes featuring solitary figures bathed in window light, hinting at narratives left intentionally vague.\"(With) the single person lost in her thoughts, theres a certain mystery, so we can relate to the feelings, emotions of the persons we see,\" Koja said. \"In a way, none of his contemporaries were able to do that.\"Art historians arent sure where Vermeer learned to paint, who he learned from, if he had any students of his own or who his subjects were. It is thought that the work above, an alllegory of painting, is a self-portrait with his daughter. Credit: Kunsthistorisches Museum ViennaThe identities of Vermeers subjects are an enigma, too, including the woman in his most famous work, \"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\" Art historians are also still debating the techniques he used to create his optical illusions, particularly the question of whether he used a \"camera obscura\" -- a dark room with a pinhole that projects a photographic image -- to create his depth of field. Its not even known where Vermeer learned to paint or who he learned from -- a lineage that is typically well-documented for art historys masters.Who painted over Cupid in \"Girl Reading a Letter at the Open Window,\" or why they did, may never be solved. The painting came from a French collection in the early 18th century, when Vermeer wasnt well known -- he had died in deep debt in 1675. Koja suggested that the painting may have been modified to more closely resemble the work of Rembrandt, possibly by the collections Flemish steward, who was also an artist.\"Woman in Blue Reading a Letter\" illustrates many of the same themes: a solitary figure reading a letter in a familiar domestic space, lit by the light of a window to the left. Credit: Gemäldegalerie Alte MeisterAltering someone elses painting \"was quite typical at the time,\" Koja said. \"Paintings have been changed according to taste... Nowadays, we think its completely inconceivable how you could touch a Vermeer but others (in) centuries before us were not that hesitant.\"Several other Vermeer paintings were inexplicably altered, as well, Koja explained, from an entire blue sky painted into his early work \"Diana and her Companions\" to a modified picture frame in \"Woman Holding a Balance.\" (Both paintings have since been restored to their original compositions.)A familiar faceTo recover the Cupid, conservators at Dresden State Art Collections decided not to remove the original 17th-century varnish, but instead meticulously chipped away at layers of paint with a medical scalpel under a microscope with 120x magnification, according to Koja. The process took two and a half years, with only a few square millimeters covered each day.The Cupid they revealed was a familiar one. Standing upright, his left arm raised and his right arm holding a bow, the blond, chubby cherub has appeared in other Vermeer works. The god of love plays a supporting role in \"Girl Interrupted at Her Music,\" housed by the Frick Collection in New York, as well as in \"Young Woman Standing at a Virginal,\" which the Dresden museum has borrowed from the National Gallery in London for its new show.The same cupid has appeared in other works. According to art historian Stephan Koja, Vermeer may have owned the painting it was based on. Credit: Gemäldegalerie Alte MeisterKoja said it is suspected that the newly discovered Cupid was based on a real painting in the artists possession. An inventory of his widows belongings from 1676 references \"a Cupid,\" according to The Art Newspaper.His appearance alters the meaning of one of Vermeers most pivotal works -- one that represented a major shift in the artists career. Vermeers earliest paintings were not set in contemporary middle-class homes, but were grand works depicting religious and mythological subjects, from Jesus Christ to the goddess Diana. By the late 1650s, however, he had begun turning his eye to modern subjects -- what became known as \"genre paintings\" of everyday life that are the hallmark of the Dutch Golden Age.\"Girl Reading a Letter By the Window is really the essential piece of his transformation from a history painter to the painter of modern life -- to the Vermeer we know today,\" Koja said.Soon after completing the painting, the artist embarked on his most famous subjects and motifs: young women (and the occasional man) lost in thought in the quietude of rooms cast with mid-day light. The viewers presence can be sensed, too, as we peer in on figures playing music, reading mysterious letters or contemplating objects heavy with philosophical meaning. Vermeers subjects are sometimes interrupted by our presence, turning to gaze at our intrusion.\"Whats so fantastic about Vermeer is that he leaves things open, and leaves them to our imagination,\" Koja said. \"And its (like) every kind of art -- be it music, theater or film. I think you like most of the ones that have a certain mystery to them... like movie directors who give you clues and then let you finish the idea. This is something which Vermeer mastered.\"Motion caption: The restoration of \"Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window.\" Photographs courtesy of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/vermeer-gemaldegalerie-2021-hidden-cupid/index.html"}, {"title": "'I could have really used a hero like this': Destin Daniel Cretton discusses his Marvel debut and the 'burden' he carried into 'Shang-Chi'", "data_published": "2021-09-03T07:03:40Z", "content": "Thomas Page Sandy Thin, CNN Written byThis feature is part of CNN Styles new series Hyphenated , which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.Destin Daniel Cretton is reflecting on what his younger self would have made of all this.

And, surprisingly, I got the gig.CNN: You have a lot of new characters to introduce to audiences in a short space of time. You also dont want to cut corners. How did you approach that challenge in the screenwriting?Cretton: It is a lot to squeeze into two hours and 10 minutes. Our first cut of the movie was three hours long. A lot of it is done in the editing room, trying to find what the right pacing is, how much information is actually repetitive, what you can get away with not saying, and what actually helps when you cut it out. Its difficult to introduce a new character and try to add dimension to all of these characters, who could so easily fall into stereotypical traps. That was the primary thing that we were really hoping we would not be contributing to: previous stereotypes. We were carrying the burden of (that) into this movie.From left: Menger Zhang as Xialing, Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and Awkwafina as Katy. \"If you lined up all of our actors, they all are drastically different personalities, from very different backgrounds,\" says the director. Credit: Jasin Boland/Marvel StudiosCNN: A big part of Simu Lius and Awkwafinas characters, Shang-Chi and Katy, is their refusal to be pigeonholed into a definition of who they are and what they might want to do -- which cultural identity they should be aligning with. How important was that for you? What conversations did you have with the cast to explore these ideas?Cretton: A big part of the casting process was finding actors who I knew would identify with these characters in some way through their lived experience. If you lined up all of our actors, they all are drastically different personalities, from very different backgrounds. For whatever reason, Asian characters in cinema in the past have not captured the variety of personalities that I know in my everyday life. Thats what we wanted to try to capture in this movie.Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan and Simu Liu as Shang-Chi in one of the fight scenes in \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.\" Credit: Marvel StudiosCNN: We have to talk about the action sequences. Theyre some of the most exciting in any Marvel film. You had the late stunt coordinator Brad Allan (\"Gorgeous,\" \"Kick Ass\") on board, Andy Cheng (\"Rush Hour\") as fight coordinator, and Bill Pope (\"The Matrix\") behind the camera. Can you walk us through the choreography and the storytelling behind these scenes?Cretton: The process started with location. All of my favorite fight scenes or action sequences in cinema can usually be described with one word: the location. It really was a huge collaboration with Brad Allan and his incredible team. He was given the scenario \"runaway bus,\" we have some beats of the plot mapped out, and then they just go off and start doing their magic.I, like maybe many other people, tune out quite often when it comes to action. In this movie, I wanted to make sure that the characters and the storyline was constantly moving through every action sequence. That happened to be very much in line with the way Brad Allan thinks and his choreographers think. They are filmmakers and storytellers first, and then come the beautiful martial arts and everything that they have learned through being part of Jackie Chans stunt team.CNN: Can we talk about some of the reference points?Cretton: The references are endless, going back to movies like \"36 Chambers (of Shaolin),\" to the fun, zany tone of \"Kung Fu Hustle.\" The really fun part of working with this team was referencing movies that they did. I could talk to Andy and reference a Jackie Chan movie and then hed pull up a clip and say, \"Oh, yeah, thats me right there.\" Their knowledge of the history of this genre and their deep respect for the art form was really what we were leaning on.Director Destin Daniel Cretton, fight coordinator Andy Cheng, crew camera operator and actor Simu Liu on set.

I would have kicked myself if I didnt at least try to be a part of that conversation; to create a character that a generation of kids who look like me, or have a similar cultural background as me, would be able to have something that I did not have as a kid.CNN: What would a young Destin have made of Shang-Chi?Cretton: I could have really used a hero like this. Whose strength is found ultimately in his ability to look inside himself, to understand himself, to understand the good parts and the difficult parts, and the pain and the joyful memories. And I could have used a role model to understand those themes probably early on in my life.

The ambitious 150,000-acre proposal promises eco-friendly architecture, sustainable energy production and a purportedly drought-resistant water system. A so-called \"15-minute city design\" will allow residents to access their workplaces, schools and amenities within a quarter-hour commute of their homes.Although planners are still scouting for locations, possible targets include Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Texas and the Appalachian region, according to the projects official website.The announcement was accompanied by a series of digital renderings by Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the architecture firm hired to bring Lores utopian dream to life. The images show residential buildings covered with greenery and imagined residents enjoying abundant open space. With fossil-fuel-powered vehicles banned in the city, autonomous vehicles are pictured traveling down sun-lit streets alongside scooters and pedestrians.Another image depicts a proposed skyscraper, dubbed Equitism Tower, which is described as \"a beacon for the city.\" The building features elevated water storage, aeroponic farms and an energy-producing photovoltaic roof that allow it to \"share and distribute all it produces.\"RELATED: A short history of the worlds tallest buildingsThe first phase of construction, which would accommodate 50,000 residents across 1,500 acres, comes with an estimated cost of $25 billion. The whole project would be expected to exceed $400 billion, with the city reaching its target population of 5 million within 40 years.Funding will come from \"various sources,\" project organizers said, including private investors, philanthropists, federal and state grants, and economic development subsidies. Planners hope to approach state officials \"very soon,\" with a view to welcoming the first residents by 2030.A new urban modelIn addition to innovative urban design, the project also promises transparent governance and what it calls a \"new model for society.\" Taking its name from the ancient Greek word \"telos\" (a term used by the philosopher Aristotle to describe an inherent or higher purpose), the city would allow residents to \"participate in the decision-making and budgeting process.\" A community endowment will meanwhile offer residents shared ownership of the land.In a promotional video, Lore described his proposal as the \"most open, most fair and most inclusive city in the world.\"Lore founded jet.com before selling it to Walmart and joining the retail giant as head of US e-commerce in 2016. He left the company earlier this year, saying that his retirement plans included working on a reality TV show, advising startups and building a \"city of the future.\"On Telosas official website, Lore explains that he was inspired by American economist and social theorist Henry George. The investor cites capitalisms \"significant flaws,\" attributing many of them to \"the land ownership model that America was built on.\"\"Cities that have been built to date from scratch are more like real estate projects,\" Lore said in a promotional video for the project. \"They dont start with people at the center. Because if you started with people at the center, you would immediately think, OK, whats the mission and what are the values?\"The mission of Telosa is to create a more equitable and sustainable future.

Usually featuring his kin and friends, the large-scale oil and acrylic works are cast in warm and welcoming colors. In one painting, a brown-skinned girl in a tubi, a tubular hairstyle crafted by Dominican women to preserve our salon blow-outs, eats her breakfast. In other works, a Black woman bottle-feeds her baby while sitting in a bright blue rocker, and a young Black couple await their destiny as they document their nuptials on their wedding day.Touching on race, class and immigration, Vasquez taps into his first-hand experiences and that of his subjects. The genesis of Vasquezs pieces start with photographs, which he takes himself of family members in the US or back in the Dominican Republic, staging relaxed scenes with them that turn into more profound moments on the canvas.\"Noches en el Pueblo de Dios\" (2020) 40\" x 60\", Oil, acrylic, and oil stick on canvas. Credit: Courtesy Raelis VasquezTwo of his works are currently showcased at New York Citys El Museo del Barrio for \"Estamos Bien -- La Trienal 20/21\" -- the museums first and major survey of Latinx contemporary art, guest-curated by esteemed Dominican American artist Elia Alba . Vasquez is the youngest artist in the show, and his paintings show the joy of lively gatherings in the campo (meaning rural areas or the countryside in Spanish-speaking countries and within the Latinx diaspora). \"Noches en el Pueblo de Dios,\" from 2020 (\"Nights in Pueblo de Dios\"), pays tribute to the small town he grew up in in the Dominican Republic, in the northwestern city of Mao, known for its many rivers and vivid red sunsets. In the painting, folks of various skin tones gather for conversations and cervezas.Over the phone, Vasquez speaks thoughtfully about a recent trip back to the island, his second visit so far in 2021. He recounts spending time with his brother and extended family in Mao and road tripping across the country, to coastal cities Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata as well as Santiago.\"Mercado en Dajabon\" (2021) 72\" x 72\" Oil, acrylic, and oil pastels on canvas. Credit: Courtesy Raelis Vasquez\"The Dominican Republic has so much beauty and so many beautiful things to go and see and explore,\" he said. \"One of the main things, (especially) me being an artist, is being in the capital in Santo Domingo.\"For Vasquez, who immigrated with his family to New Jersey at seven years old in 2002, coming home, reconnecting with family and being nourished by Dominican culture is the creative sustenance that feeds his compelling and intimate paintings. His most recent trip, he said, will be where he draws inspiration for his next works.\"Im always working, always capturing, Im always writing, and Im doing sketches, reading,\" he said of his time there. \"I take time away from the day-to-day studio work and do that other kind of work while Im out there.\"A wider range of representationThough theres finally an increased focus on contemporary Latinx art (separate from Latin American art), the struggle continues to ensure Black, Indigenous and Asian representation within Latine communities.\"Del Otro Lado de Dajabon\" (2020) 30\" x 48\" oil, acrylic, and oil stick on canvas. Credit: Courtesy Raelis VasquezVasquez and other rising Black Latine contemporary artists such as Yelaine Rodriguez (who curated \"Afro Syncretic\") and Joiri Minaya, continue building deeply nuanced Black Latinx narratives that artists like Fabiola Jean-Louis and Firelei Báez have crafted for more than a decade. These artists disrupt limited and monolithic ideas on Latinx identity (which racially centers white Latinx and mestizxs as the default), and explore the multi-dimensionality of Blackness. Vasquez does so simply by spotlighting his Black Dominican loved ones in everyday scenes made monumental in scale with genuine relatability.\"I would say that by the sheer representation of the culture that I come from, I give this identity of Latinx a wider range of perceptions,\" he said. \"In the US people usually think of Latinx folks, or people from Latin America, in one way.\" But, as Vasquez points out, the range of skin tones within his own family challenges that idea. \"The way that my family looks, side-by-side, you would think youre talking about the whole Latin America just like, phenotypically,\" he said. \"I think its important to have more voices from these wide categories, so that we can really see the nuances and really appreciate the differences and similarities, because we all have our similarities as well.\"Growing as an artistFor Vasquez, art has long given him a sense of freedom and refuge in processing and praising his Afro Dominican identity. He turned to drawing as a child while he was adjusting culturally in the US, and by high school, his talent had blossomed.\"I think it was a consequence of the immigration process,\" he said. \"It was drawing, that thing that I could control in this environment (where) I felt really out of place, and in an environment I couldnt control.\"After attending community college in New Jersey, he enrolled at School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), which, although prestigious, isnt known for its diversity.\"Birthdays like Ours\" (2021) 36\" x 36\" oil, acrylic, and oil stick on canvas. Credit: Courtesy Raelis VasquezVasquez used the time there to reflect on his sense of self, which became fundamental to his growth as an artist creating Black Latinx narratives.\"It allowed me space to think about what Ive been through, who I am, (and) where I come from,\" he said. \"I think it took being out of this DR, New Jersey, East Coast, New York, very Caribbean, kind of culture, because once youre in it, you think everything is normal, until youre removed from it.\" In Chicago, he added, \"that was the first time I started thinking about the fact that we immigrated.\"Now a Columbia University MFA student, Vasquezs career is thriving despite the uncertainty and frustration of the pandemic. Last September, Vasquez and fellow Afro Dominican American painter Tiffany Alfonseca collaborated on a two-person show, \" Como Nosotros Somos ,\" (\"How We Are\") in Los Angeles, bringing together their figurative and vibrant approaches to the multi-layered experiences of Black Latinx identities. This past spring, Vasquez was included in \" Shattered Glass ,\" a blockbuster group show at Jeffrey Deitch in Los Angeles, featuring Black and POC artists organized by two young Black curators, the gallerys director Melahn Frierson and AJ Girard. The show included Vasquezs recent painting \"Mercado en Dajabón,\" which respectfully shows the everyday survival of Haitian immigrants in the border market town of Dajabón in the Dominican Republic.\"La Mesa Nuestra\"(2021) 60\" x 84\" Oil, acrylic, and oil pastels on canvas.

Telling the story of a couple whose imminent separation is put on hold by a stay-at-home order, it was among the first movies to be entirely written and filmed during the Covid-19 pandemicAs its title suggests, the story addressed contemporary struggles. But detractors posited that the film missed an opportunity to explore the shared anxieties of nationwide lockdowns, while others conceded that it might have been better received with the benefit of several years hindsight.When the project was first announced, the pandemic had been raging for months though vaccinations were still a distant dream. The story of a relationship tested through a mandatory stay-at-home order might have seemed, from a studio perspective, like a no-brainer: Of course people could relate to it.But for audiences that may have been part of the problem, according to Karen Dill-Shackleford, a social psychologist at Fielding Graduate University and editor of the journal Psychology of Popular Media.Anne Hathaway in a still from \"Locked Down,\" a romance heist movie set during the pandemic. Credit: Susie Allnutt/HBO Max\"There are two ways of coping with trauma: active and passive coping,\" said Dill-Shackleford. \"Some people like to engage more with the news surrounding the pandemic because it makes them feel as though they have some control over it. Others cope through avoidance, and for them escapism is key.\"Crucially, however, there is no single type of story audiences want to watch, she added. \"We have different needs depending on our lived experiences, and those needs also change as we process our trauma.\"Throughout the early months of the pandemic in the US, many viewers gravitated towards shows and movies they had seen before. \"People dont want any surprises in the media they consume when they have enough uncertainty in their daily lives,\" Dill-Shackleford explained. \"They need to know that everything turns out OK in the end.\"Inundated with daily updates about case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths, some people may have found comfort in re-watching shows because they didnt need to pay close attention to what was happening on screen, Dill-Shackleford added. When reality demands our constant concern, it may be comforting to disengage from the outside world and let our minds amble through a story about mask-less teenagers finding a prom date.A still from the 1995 \"Outbreak,\" starring Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman. Credit: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyAt the other end of the spectrum, however, plenty of viewers were seeking out depictions of fictional pandemics. As the virus cases surged across Europe and closed in on the US in the first months of 2020, so too did downloads and streams of 2011s \"Contagion,\" a movie about an American woman who returns from a trip to Hong Kong as the unknowing carrier of a novel respiratory virus. By mid-March, shortly after the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic, \"Outbreak\" (which portrays the rush to contain a fictional, ebola-like virus in California) became the ninth most popular movie on Netflix in the US.Erase or embrace?This bifurcated approach to media consumption may have left storytellers unsure of whether -- or to what degree -- they should broach the social, financial and physical issues surrounding the pandemic. Should they lean into the trauma by offering comfort and solidarity to viewers, or should they ignore the pandemic completely by depicting an alternate reality in which the terms \"social distancing,\" \"lockdown,\" and \"essential worker\" had never entered the mainstream lexicon?The answer, according to Dill-Shackleford, is a resounding \"it depends.\"\"The decisions to portray the pandemic on screen are more intense than other storytelling decisions,\" she said. \"Writers and directors dont know which part of their audience theyre providing a service for and which part of their audience cant bring themselves to watch.\"A still from season six of \"Superstore,\" which explored how coronavirus impacted the shows characters. Credit: Greg Gayne/NBCThis isnt the first time studios have faced such quandaries in the wake of a deadly event -- and their approaches have varied. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for instance, manifested in Ishiro Hondas 1954 film \"Godzilla\" as a creature that wreaks havoc on helpless citizens. Rather than shying away from fears of nuclear holocaust, the movie reflected Japanese anxiety around nuclear destruction.Conversely, after 9/11 many US storytellers avoided tackling the tragedy head-on. Several TV shows that were set in or around New York, like \"Sex and the City,\" and \"The Sopranos,\" simply removed the World Trade Center from their opening credits following the attacks rather than examining the impact it might have had on the characters lives.Some shows have taken a similar approach to Covid-19. The new \"Gossip Girl\" reboot, for instance, began filming last November, though Covid-19 appears to have been eradicated in the fictionalized New York City in which the story is set.But series revolving around frontline healthcare workers and grocery store employees, like \"Greys Anatomy\" and \"Superstore,\" clearly felt more obligated to portray their experiences on-screen. One of the most prominent examples of pandemic storytelling came from season seven of ABCs comedy \"Black-ish,\" which explored the ways Covid-19 affected members of the Johnson family as they work, attend school (via Zoom) and live in close proximity to one another.At one point, father Dre (Anthony Anderson) slumps down on the couch and admits that hes been feeling irritable and anxious, complaining that \"nothing feels normal.\" His anesthesiologist wife, Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross), shakes her head sympathetically and responds, \"Nothing is normal, Dre. Were disinfecting boxes ... I microwaved our mail yesterday. So its understandable that youre stressed, sweetie. We dont have any of our normal coping mechanisms ... Were used to living life with certainty and we dont have that anymore.\"Dill-Shackleford said that this type of on-screen exchange demonstrates the therapeutic potential of media. \"In many ways -- and especially as we are struggling in the moment -- we rely on these stories to make us feel as if were not alone,\" she said.Benefit of hindsightAt this stage in the pandemic, Dill-Shackleford said, depicting Covid-19 remains a double-edged sword. Even among viewers who are comfortable talking about the events of the past 18 months, there is \"a certain level of exhaustion\" with the topic.\"With some people (who are) becoming vaccinated and starting to slowly carve out a new normal, the last thing they want to do now is be reminded of the head space they were in a year ago,\" Dill-Shackleford said.Tracee Ellis Ross depicting her character Bow, who is a first responder, in the season seven premiere of \"black-ish.\" Credit: ABCFor others, especially those living in areas with surging cases and hospitalizations, we are \"still in the middle of death and disease\" and \"dealing with issues with vaccine hesitancy,\" said Chrysalis Wright, the director of the Media & Migration Lab at the University of Central Florida. \"Some people simply dont have the distance,\" she added, to \"sit back and enjoy\" a movie exploring these heavy themes.Wright believes future renderings of the coronavirus pandemic should flesh out the nuances in how it affected different segments of our societies.\"When enough time has passed for us to reflect on this era, I would really like to see movies and television shows that take into account these experiences,\" she said, adding that the impact of Covid-19 varies according to peoples backgrounds. \"For example, show how the pandemic disproportionately affected Black Americans; discuss the increase in hate crimes towards Asian Americans.\"Those who went through particularly traumatic experiences, such as losing loved ones, losing a job or struggling with mental health issues, may naturally shy away from content that forces them to relive their ordeal. But, Wright said, the general public will benefit from having these stories produced for mass consumption.\"Even if you cant stomach sitting through these movies or television shows, its critical for other people to be able to understand the far-reaching repercussions of the public health crisis from other perspectives,\" she added. \"Seeing different experiences represented on screen helps establish empathy between people of different backgrounds.\"Another still from \"Locked Down,\" which was released in January. Credit: Susie Allnutt/HBO MaxAs countries around the world attempt to restore a semblance of normalcy, audiences may also seek out narratives that showcase early pandemic experiences as a way of achieving closure, said Wright.\"If we see a character losing their job, struggling with working from home, or navigating remote learning, it validates us,\" she explained. \"If we didnt do it perfectly, its fine because nobody did it perfectly.\"Regardless of viewers current media consumption habits, both Dill-Shackleford and Wright hope that future portrayals on the pandemic will inspire discourse about individual and collective experiences alike.\"If a show or movie chooses to address the pandemic, I hope they do so in a way that helps their audience think through the events theyve lived through,\" said Dill-Shackleford.\"Theres a bidirectional experience between ourselves and the media we consume,\" added Wright. \"Media reflects our experiences and, at the same time, it influences our behaviors and future experiences.\"Top image: Jude Law in the 2011 movie \"Contagion.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/covid-tv-shows-movies/index.html"}, {"title": "This 'imperfect' virtual influencer is challenging beauty standards in China", "data_published": "2021-08-19T01:16:25Z", "content": "Written by Amanda Florian, CNN\"Your skins a bit dry,\" one user commented on a video posted by Angie, a popular influencer who first appeared on Chinese social media last fall. \"You should apply a face mask.\"In the video, uploaded to Douyin, the original Chinese version of TikTok, Angies skin looks bumpy and uneven.

Angie started taking shape in July 2020, and within three months Zhang had posted his characters first video to Douyin. By December, she had already gained around 100,000 fans.\"I didnt think she would take off so quickly,\" he said, attributing her popularity to her calming, casual videos.\"Her characteristics and details all have a bit of this real-life feeling,\" Zhang said. \"But she also has some things a real person wouldnt have.

Now, Im doing much better,\" one fan wrote. \"As I was getting ready to take an afternoon nap, I saw your video and was put in an even better mood!\"The follower said they were prepping for the upcoming semester, and that they would strive to work hard in school. \"Keep pressing on,\" Angie wrote in response, adding that sad moments will become things of the past.\"The reason why I like her is that Angie is more realistic than many people who are actually real,\" one of her followers Xiao Qi, a millennial living in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, told CNN. \"She gives the impetuous world a touch of beauty.\"Low-risk influencersFor now, Zhang has no plans to monetize Angie by livestreaming, though he is open to collaborations. If the designer were to cash in on the market for virtual influencers, however, he may find a willing audience -- on Douyin, fans often support their favorite content creators by sending money during livestreams, ranging from a couple cents to hundreds of dollars or more.For marketers, virtual influencers are a low-risk alternative to real-life stars -- theyre available at all hours of the day to do whatever is required with minimum fuss.

In some campaigns they have come across as inauthentic or too commercialized, she added, like when internet users called out virtual influencer Ling when she posted about Gucci lipstick. According to Chen, fans were unconvinced.\"Followers question if its appropriate for virtual influencers to speak for beauty and skincare products whose performance needs to be verified by (human) touches,\" Chen said.Red Ant Asias co-founder Elisa Harca agrees, seeing a future where brands digital and real-life influencers coexist.\"With any kind of marketing you want to find a blended program so not all your eggs are in one basket,\" she said. \"Diversity is key in digital -- its never one size fits all. And you have things that will appeal more to the masses, and more to certain tribes.\"Shifting beauty standardsAngies real-life characteristics are part of her appeal -- but they have also attracted criticism online. Some Douyin users have disapproved of her thick thighs, creased makeup, faint acne scars and uneven skin.Underneath one video, in which Angie is seen sipping Coca-Cola, one user asked why she wasnt created with \"double eyelids.\" (Around half of East Asian and Southeast Asian women are born with double eyelids.

Though there are signs that attitudes may be slowly changing -- with stars like the tanned and curvy singer Wang Ju increasingly in the spotlight -- female celebrities are often slim and dewy-skinned.There is still huge pressure on women to conform to certain beauty ideals, according to Jaehee Jung, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware. Her research into perceptions of attractiveness among college students in Shanghai found that most wanted to change something about their bodies -- for example, slimmer bodies or bigger eyes.\"Many of these young women think, Wow, you have to keep up with beauty trends, otherwise youre considered lazy,\" Jung said.As such, an imperfect virtual character like Angie is, Jung suggested, more relatable for many Chinese girls and women.\"I think its refreshing that you find the complete opposite figure who is almost like a regular person -- and she doesnt have to look like anyone else,\" she said. \"I think for many viewers, they see themselves.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/angie-douyin-virtual-influencer/index.html"}, {"title": "The Gen Z TikTok accounts capturing the beauty of small-town America", "data_published": "2021-08-19T09:00:55Z", "content": "Written by Leah Dolan, CNNA northwest Arkansas resident since 2013, Gulbranson quickly put down roots after moving to Fayetteville for college.

The quirks of close-knit communities have been spun into comedy gold -- via the likes of Emmy Award-winning sitcom \"Schitts Creek\" -- and the stuff of Lynchian nightmares in cult TV series \"Twin Peaks.\" Netflix crime drama \"Ozark,\" set less than four hours from Gulbransons town, depicts the surrounding area as an unassuming rural backwater -- ideal for undisturbed money-laundering.But now, rural America is being refracted through a different lens, as Gen Z residents share scenes from their environment on TikTok.In Edward Hoppers \"Gas\" (1940) artificial lights mingle with the fading day as a lonely worker tends to cherry-red gas pumps that fuel the expeditions of an entire nation.

You couldnt really get many places without a car. I knew every single person at my school since I was 5, because its just like that in a small town. But Ive grown to appreciate it so much more. Its such a beautiful place.\"The fulfillment of filmingIn a small way, these videos reclaim wider narratives that malign suburban and rural living. According to a July 2020 report from Pew Research, the proportion of people aged 18 to 29 living with one or both of their parents had risen to over 50% as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the face of rising rents across urban cities like New York and Los Angeles , rekindling a love for hometowns and more affordable areas feels pragmatic as well as romantic.Last August, Isobel Straub embarked on a mighty six-week cross-country road trip, beginning in New England and wrapping around the West Coast before finally finishing in Colorado. To document her trip of a lifetime, Straub made a habit of filming daily diary-style videos which quickly racked up tens of thousands -- and on occasion, millions -- of views. Upon returning home, Straub was keen to continue making the videos that had by now become a habit. But Burlington, Vermont didnt feel as exciting at first.\"I used to be a super negative person. And I just hated the drudgery that each day brings,\" said the 21-year-old in a phone interview. \"But I just continued documenting my normal, everyday life. Instead of going on these grand adventures, I was just doing my mundane stuff.\"Straub, who grew up in a small town in Maine, is at the center of her videos. In between early morning cups of coffee on the porch and barista shifts at the nearby bakery, her documented life is everything suburban living is set up to be: pleasant and wholesome. There are more than 272,000 curious followers keeping tabs on Staubs life, watching her climb trees, meet up with friends at the farmers market, or literally drive off into the sunset, as she moves through what feels like an infinite cut of \"Dawsons Creek.\"\"I definitely do appreciate the area that I live in more,\" Straub said. \"I just feel like Im constantly so aware of the present moment all the time. I think those videos just really helped me get to that point.\"For Lombardi, filming his hometown legitimized it in a way, too, allowing him to see Skaneateles through fresh eyes. \"It makes you reconsider, seeing what other people say. Ill record a place or an activity and seeing how other people react to it makes me realize, Oh, that was kind of special,\" he said.Gulbransons TikTok account documents a quiet life in the Ozarks. Credit: Ashlyn Gulbranson/@PineacreBut not everyone finds the regional landscapes charming. \"Some people said, This is what my nightmares look like,\" recalled Gulbranson, after she posted a recording of her local grocery store and its outdated decor. \"Some said horrible things like, This makes me want to die.\"Regardless of criticism, Gulbranson views her account as necessary documentation of a dying form of architecture.\"Where I live in northwest Arkansas, its like the hub of Walmart,\" she said, referring to the chains looming corporate presence. There are 120 Walmart stores dotted around Arkansas, with the company headquarters located in the town neighboring Gulbranson.\"Theyre bringing in a lot of change to this area. And so I feel the urge to document all of these businesses and places that I think are amazing, because Ive seen them slowly fade out or get remodeled trying to keep up with the growth.\"For Gulbranson, there are more similarities than differences between her corner of Arkansas and the America depicted by Hopper. \"I was doing a lot of research on him a couple of months ago,\" she said, \"about the pandemic 100 years ago and how artists reacted to it. I think its really interesting how even throughout art history, theres this abstract loneliness people were trying to convey. Hes my biggest inspiration.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/small-town-america-tiktok/index.html"}, {"title": "Moving portraits of gay fathers with their families across America", "data_published": "2021-06-15T07:46:56Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNKeeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.A family of two dads and two young sons lay sprawled among white bed sheets, their hair mussed, pillows pushed aside during the reflexive movements of sleep. The boys take up most of the space despite their small frames; one child reaches his arm across his fathers neck, their faces pressed together in a tender hug.Such a photograph would have been extraordinarily rare just decades ago, but now it is one of many published in the book \"Dads,\" a four-year visual archive of gay fatherhood across America that began in 2016. The dad responsible for the book is Bart Heynen, a Belgian portrait photographer who now lives in Brooklyn. And though the early morning photo he took of his own family sleeping was shot in Antwerp, he included it among the collection of images from New York, Utah, Alabama, Nebraska, Minnesota, California, and all the other states he visited to take portraits of fathers at home.\"I felt a little bit lonely as a gay dad -- although there are two of us -- but lonely in the sense that all the other families I knew were straight parents,\" Heynen said in a video call, explaining why he began photographing the series. \"I also thought it was important for (my kids) to see other families with gay dads.\"\"Dads\" is a four-year photo series of gay fathers around the country. Credit: Bart Heynen/powerHouse BooksHeynen has been with his partner Rob Heyvaert for 25 years after sharing an elevator ride in their building in Antwerp. When they began their relationship, same-sex marriage wasnt legal in in Belgium, and kids were far from Heynens mind. Even in their progressive country, same-sex adoption wasnt legalized until 2003, and paid surrogacy is still banned.When, a decade ago, Heynen and Heyvaert wanted to start a family, they decided to look for an egg donor and surrogate far from home, in California -- a state with more progressive and inclusive laws. (In the US, while same-sex parents have fought for their rights since the 1960s and 1970s, the laws for paid surrogacy remain patchwork by state.)Now they have their 10-year-old twins, Ethan and Noah, who often joined Heynen on his shoots. Heynen recalled that Ethan, fascinated by other two-father families, loved to ask them, \"Whos the papa and whos the daddy?\"The spectrum of fatherhood\"Dads\" seeks to show the full spectrum of fatherhood in the US: married couples, single fathers and widowers; families in the cities and the suburbs; men of different races, ethnicities and religion; and family units that include close relationships to surrogates.And the book is publishing at a time when their rights are still being contested at the countrys highest court. This week, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Roman Catholic foster agency that lost its contract with the city of Philadelphia for refusing to work with same-sex couples.\"For many people, the book will be an introduction to gay fatherhood. And so I wanted to walk a fine line between showing that our families are the same as any other straight family,\" he explained. \"But at the same time, we have a lot of unique characteristics that are not found in straight families, starting with creating the family.\"Heynen was often present for special moments, including the first hours of a newborns life. Credit: Bart Heynen/powerHouse BooksIncluding some of the women who acted as surrogates for the family was particularly important. For Heynen, they represent additional love and care and help illustrate some of the decision-making that, though not exclusive to them, all gay fathers must contend with. Adoption or surrogacy? Who will be the biological parent? How much will they share with their kids? Will the surrogate be transactional in nature, or will someone close to the family carry the child to term?In Heynen and Heyvaerts case, they met the birth mother in California only one month before Ethan and Noah were born due to the rules of the agency they used.\"We were extremely nervous...and then it was a wonderful (but) very intense moment,\" Heynen recalled. \"I took photographs because I wanted to show my kids all of us together so they could see because theyre not allowed to see their biological mom until theyre 18.\"Changing the imageHeynens images often reveal these decisions and the hardships and joy they bring. In one instance, he photographed Mow and Chris cradling their newborn at a gas station during their 14-hour car ride from Tennessee back to their home in New York, as paid surrogacy was not allowed in New York until earlier this year. Another portrait shows the deep bonds of an entire extended family involved in a babys birth: Elliot and Matthew are pictured in Omaha, Nebraska with their daughter, Uma, as well as Elliots sister and Matthews mother, who were Umas egg donor and surrogate, respectively.In Salt Lake City, Utah, Heynen spent the day with Bryce Abplanalp and Jeffrey Wright, their two children, and Julie, their surrogate. The couple, who met as adults, were raised Mormon, serving as missionaries before eventually leaving the church.\"We always knew that we wanted to have kids... (but) we really struggled to find a surrogate because we do live in Utah,\" Abplanalp said in a video call. \"Most of the women are Mormon, and Mormons dont believe in gay marriage and gays having kids.\"Heynen shows how much love can go into a single birth. Here, baby Uma is pictured with her parents, aunt (her egg donor) and grandmother (her birth mother). Credit: Bart Heynen/powerHouse BooksAfter a years-long process, they met Julie, who lives a half-hour away with her husband and two kids. They now see each other every couple of weeks, with and without their children, forming a lasting bond between the two families.\"I dont think we realized the type of relationship that we would have now,\" Abplanalp said. \"I mean, were really good friends.\"Heynen, as well as the fathers he photographed, hope that the photographs in \"Dads\" will dispel some of the hurtful stereotypes that still linger around gay fatherhood.DaRel and Charles Barksdale are raising their three-year-old adopted son Braeden in Mitchellville, Maryland. Charles recalled a time when a woman asked them in an airport, \"What do you guys know about taking care of babies?\"\"I think that this (book) is going to hopefully help change the image of fathering,\" said Charles Barksdale, pictured here with husband DaRel and son Braeden. Credit: Bart Heynen/powerHouse Books\"Ive worked with children my whole life,\" Charles said, explaining that he works in schools as a speech pathologist. \"I know a lot about taking care of babies. I think that this (book) is going to hopefully help change the image of fathering.\"Abplanalp said he and Wright have never shied away from sharing their own experiences. Abplanalp never knew when he was younger that fatherhood would be possible for him as gay man. \"We dont try to be role models or make ourselves any more important than we are,\" he said. \"Were just trying to be as visible as we can to help somebody else who is in a dark place and doesnt know everything thats possible in the world.\"Dads ,\" published by powerHouse Books, is available June 29.Add to Queue: Papas and daddiesHosted by West Hollywood couple Yan and Alex, the dads use each episode to chat parenting and relationships, and lately have been focusing each episode on the gay rights and fatherhood pathways by country, and inviting a gay father from each location on as a guest.This black comedy-drama of the early aughts was genre-defying and barrier-breaking in many ways, but it has been particularly hailed for the onscreen romance of Michael C.

In his highly anticipated show, \"Wat U Iz,\" the designer sent models down a vivid blue runway in larger-than-life garments referencing everyday objects created by Black inventors.The live-streamed showcase took place two days later than anticipated, after torrential downpours saw the first attempt called off. With a hasty 48 hours to restage months of work, Jean-Raymond finally showed his collection on Saturday. It comprised high-concept, meticulously fabricated clothing based on recognizable items, including a bicycle, traffic light, chessboard, fire escape, Super Soaker, refrigerator and mop.Former Black Panther Party chairwoman Elaine Brown spoke ahead of the show, which also featured performances from Brooklyn rapper 22Gz and a live string orchestra. The grounds were part of the story, too. The idyllic 34-room Italianate mansion was once home to Black entrepreneur and activist Madam C.J. Walker, considered to be Americas first female self-made millionaire. Born to formerly enslaved parents, Walker built a beauty empire from a single hair care product for Black women.1 / 25 Pyer Moss Haute Couture collection was inspired by Black inventors and their creations.

It was also a display of Black ingenuity -- something that \"theres no shortage of,\" Jean-Raymond said in a video interview following the show.\"Oftentimes, though, among our community, we often berate and belittle people who are making money in their respective crafts,\" he added. \"So much so that weve learned to undervalue our work and undervalue our time. Im trying to flip that narrative, because I understand that that narrative is a trap.\"Since Pyer Moss became a fashion week mainstay in 2015, the labels slick mens and womenswear collections, which meld street style and high fashion, have been worn by famous figures from Colin Kaepernick and Zendaya to US Vice President Kamala Harris.Kerby Jean-Raymond walks the runway during Pyer Moss Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2021/2022 show. Credit: Cindy Ord/WireImage/Getty ImagesSpeaking about his historic appearance on the Paris Haute Couture Week schedule, Jean-Raymond said he doesnt take the responsibility lightly. \"I wanted to use the stage to share with other Black Americans who inspire me -- and Black people who inspired me. So I chose to make the collection a highlight reel, in a way, of many of the things weve contributed to society at large.\"Layered storytellingCouture may be new ground for Jean-Raymond, who founded Pyer Moss in 2013, but his collections thoughtful reflections on Black history and culture continues the brands longstanding commitment to storytelling. Describing his label as an \"art project that operates in the fashion space,\" the Haitian-American designer told CNN Style in 2019: \"It has to represent me. It has to be a representation of the people who made it, because who needs it? Who needs clothes at this point? You can get clothes anywhere.\"A sandal-inspired look from Saturdays runway show. Credit: Cindy Ord/WireImage/Getty ImagesThere are always layers to peel back at Pyer Moss shows. At the labels headline-grabbing debut at New York Fashion Week in 2015, the specter of police brutality was present in every look, from references to Eric Garners haunting last words, \"I cant breathe,\" to clothing tagged with spatters of mock blood during the show by artist Gregory Siff.Pyer Moss then retold the American story in a three-part show, from 2018 to 2019, working with visual artist Derrick Adams on one of the collections to create powerful imagery of Black life, including a glittering crystal-embellished gown depicting a father holding his baby.And Jean-Raymonds runway venues are, like Madame CJ Walkers estate, often steeped in history. Recent locations include Weeksville, Brooklyn, the site of one of Americas first free Black communities, and the Kings Theater in nearby Flatbush, where Pyer Moss hired a 90-member gospel choir to celebrate the life of Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a Black musician often known as the godmother of rocknroll.Black prosperityFor his latest show, however, Jean-Raymond had to define what couture means for Pyer Moss, a label that relies on direct-to-consumer sales for 70 percent of its business, according to the Cut\"A lot of times when we do runway, were constantly blending these highly conceptual ideas with commerciality -- with what consumers are going to think. Whos gonna buy this?\" he said. \"But ... here it was just like, Lets just do anything we want.\"Related video: Kerby Jean-Raymond speaks to CNN Style in 2019.Having scrapped their first concept entirely, Jean-Raymond and his team based the collection on research into the US Library of Congress archive of inventions (and an outing to Joshua Tree, California, that saw them drinking psychedelic ayahuasca together).Encountering the list of Black inventions was humbling, he said. \"I was really taken aback. I pride myself on being very knowledgeable on Black history. And a lot of that stuff I didnt have (prior) knowledge of,\" he added.Bicycle handles were among the everyday objects incorporated into the designs. Credit: Cindy Ord/WireImage/Getty ImagesPyer Moss worked with fabricators to bring the objects to life, but each look was made by hand. Some, like a white long-sleeve leotard outfitted with bicycle handles, took a week to make. Others, like dresses inspired by hair curlers and a bottle caps, took months. This fall, the label plans to stage an exhibition about the collection at Madam C.J. Walkers estate together with Nicola Vassell, who this year opened the first Black-owned gallery in New Yorks Chelsea neighborhood.But illustrating what wealth looks like can be complicated -- especially when history has shown that marginalized creators are not always given the credit or compensation theyre due. \"I believe that Black wealth matters, and I wanted to put it on display,\" Jean-Raymond said.\"Heres the Super Soaker, heres the curtain rod, heres the peanut butter jar and all these other things that we had a hand in creating. But how many of those items became Black-owned industries? None of them.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/pyer-moss-paris-haute-couture-wat-u-iz/index.html"}, {"title": "'I've spent almost all my concert earnings on art': Pop star Jay Chou's collecting obsession", "data_published": "2021-06-23T02:32:37Z", "content": "Written by Megan C. Hills, CNNTaiwanese pop star Jay Chou tends to excel at whatever he puts his mind to. Hes one of Asias best-known singers, the director of an award-winning movie and a magician with his own Netflix series. But when it came to collecting art, Chou wasnt, by his own admission, instantly successful.His first foray into the art world began in Paris Le Marais neighborhood, an area renowned for its mish-mash of galleries, boutiques and bars. There, a three-dimensional, stereoscopic work caught his attention, so he purchased it and brought it back home to Taiwan.He thought the piece was \"super cool\" at the time, he recalled in a video interview from Taipei. But his art-savvy friends didnt agree. \"They said they would introduce me to a good art adviser,\" joked Chou, who buried the artwork in a warehouse and hasnt taken it out since.The \"Mandopop\" (Mandarin pop) singer has come a long way since then. At home, a pink Picasso (a color closely associated with Chou, whose legions of fans often wave pink glow sticks at his concerts) has pride of place in his office; Peter Doigs stirring \"Road Home\" hangs along his staircase above a transparent piano; and a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting has been built into the structure of Chous house, permanently encased in glass in his living room.In 2019, the 42-year-old star was named in ArtNews \" 50 Art Collectors to Watch .\" Paintings by the likes of Gerhard Richter and Frank Stella often pop up in the background of Chous music videos. On Instagram, where he has a following of 6.4 million, the singer seesaws between sharing holiday snaps, previewing his latest projects and posting art he admires, such as David Hockneys \"Portrait of an Artist,\" Philip Gustons \"The Studio\" and Vincent van Goghs \"Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear.\"At the time of our interview, Chou was promoting his recent collaboration with Sothebys auction house: A two-part contemporary art sale, personally curated by the musician. At the main auction, held Friday evening in Hong Kong , Basquiats \"Untitled\" sold for over 289 million Hong Kong dollars ($37.3 million). A separate digital sale, featuring artists including Yayoi Kusama, Ronald Ventura and Yoshitomo Nara, closed Tuesday with KAWS \" Untitled (MBFR7) \" fetching a top bid of 3.4 million Hong Kong dollars ($487,000).From pianos to artAmid the Picassos and works by celebrated Chinese French artist Zao Wou-Ki , a number of Chous concert memorabilia went under the hammer, too (a tour-worn studded Tomas Chan outfit sold for over 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $154,000). The contrast raised an unlikely question: How did a mainstream pop artist find his footing as a credible figure in the art collecting world?Chou is seemingly obsessed with nice things. He accumulates rare wines, watches and cars, though his affinity for collecting began in an unusual place: his fascination with Europe.Long before his first ill-fated art purchase in Paris, he had amassed a collection of European antiquities and ornate pianos. When he encounters an antique piano, the singer imagines everyone who has played it before him, he said. As a classically trained musician, Chou says hes drawn to European architecture and furnishings -- so much so that he and his wife, Taiwanese Australian actress Hannah Quinliven, chose a castle in Yorkshire, England, as the venue for their 2015 wedding.\"I dont know if its because I learned classical piano when I was a child, or (if) its a past life connection,\" he said.Jay Chou with an antique piano on the set of his directorial debut, \"Secret.\" The instrument was displayed at Hong Kongs K11 Musea mall ahead of the Jay Chou x Sothebys auction series. Credit: Courtesy Sothebys x EnviseamChou has been surrounded by art his entire life -- thanks, in part, to his mother Yeh Hui-mei, a former art teacher who he still turns to for collecting advice. She made art history a part of his childhood, telling tales of famous artists. She preferred Salvador Dalí to Picasso, Chou recalled in a Sothebys auction preview -- \"Dalí was more loyal to his lover,\" he is quoted as saying.When Chou decided to begin collecting art seriously, he started big. His first purchase was a work by Basquiat, an artist he admitted to not knowing much about. The celebrated painter was \"the first artist I was exposed to\" as a collector, the singer said.Chou was initially intrigued by the artworks extravagant price tag, but the more he learned about Basquiat, the more he fell in love with his work. \"Basquiat (was) a pure artist, without commercial motives. He (was) like a child, directly expressing feelings in his paintings,\" Chou explained, likening it to how Picassos works \"transcend technique.\"Since that purchase, Chou has committed to his expensive new hobby. \"Ive spent almost all my earnings from my concerts on artworks,\" he said.How do you fall in love with art?As one of Asias biggest entertainers, Chou certainly has the means. Last May, he shared a tweet claiming that his 2019 tour earnings put him seventh among the worlds male vocalists, just behind heavyweights like Ed Sheeran and Elton John. (He was also the only Asian artist on the list.) In his caption, Chou vowed his ranking would rise, saying he was \"ultracompetitive\" and needed to be \"first place in everything I do.\"According to Chous friend Jazz Li, CEO of art collective Enviseam (a collaborator on the Sothebys sale, alongside Hong Kongs K11 Group), the star is a \"really passionate guy\" and the same applies to his \"crazy\" approach to collecting art. \"Sometimes I (tell him) calm down,\" Li said. \"He gets very excited when he tries to buy something.\"At the time of our interview, Chou said his next target was Richard Princes \" Runaway Nurse ,\" one of the pieces featured in the Sothebys sale on Friday (it went on to sell for just under 94 million Hong Kong dollars, or $12.1 million, though it is not known if Chou was the buyer). He encountered the work, which was inspired by a film noir heroine, while in New York, and it left a \"deep impact\" on him, he said.Chou said that seeing Richard Princes \"Runaway Nurse\" had a \"deep impact\" on him. Credit: Courtesy Sothebys x Enviseam\"Some people put their assets in real estate, sports cars, luxurious clothes, different (categories of collectibles),\" Chou said. \"But for me, art is the most important asset class.\"Though art is very much an investment for Chou, he still purchases pieces with a view to displaying them at his home. Occasionally, he has interior designers mock up plans to display special artworks in his property, though as his collection grows, pieces have also gone into storage.But for Chou, hanging art on the wall is not only a way to beautify his house. It has another purpose altogether: \"Living with art inspires you to make more money,\" he said, \"and to buy more art.\"Imagining the futureWhile Chou is drawn to big names, he has a \"strong desire\" to support emerging artists. He can relate, he said, having spent the early part of his career songwriting and producing for other musicians behind the scenes, before releasing his breakout solo album \"Jay\" in 2000.\"People tend to look at big names like Jia Aili and Zao Wou-Ki,\" he said, referencing two prominent Asian artists. He compared collecting to running a record label, adding: \"Everybody Is always looking at the big music stars, and they dont tend to get to see the more emerging singers.\"Jay Chou reading an art book in a promotional shot for his recent collaboration with Sothebys. Credit: Courtesy Sothebys x EnviseamAn interest in lesser-known artists was apparent in his picks for the Sothebys sale, which included Angela Yuens mesmerizing spinning skylines and Fatina Kongs arresting collisions of nature and manmade cities. He names American artists Dana Schutz and Avery Singer as two of the names hes been quietly collecting.And at home, Chou is also an artistic benefactor of sorts: His children Romeo and Hathaway have started painting. Just as his own mother nurtured his love for art, Chou proudly shares his childrens passion on social media -- from 3-year-old Romeos introduction to art appreciation to the familys chaotic home art studio. (\"For the inception of the artist, dont be afraid of dirtying your home,\" he captioned the latter.)Chou reported that both children are drawn to his favorite artists. During our video call, the star proudly shows off his daughters latest project: a sketch of Chou sitting in front of a Basquiat. His wife, Quinliven, has found various places around the house to display the kids works amid blue-chip masterpieces, and Chou has even incorporated their art into his clothing line, Phantaci.Having not had time to learn to paint when he was a child, Chou said he wants to \"make up for the lost opportunity\" with his own children. As for whether they can make it as professionals, Chou reflected: \"The path to becoming an artist is hard.\"\"If my children could work at Sothebys, that wouldnt be too bad,\" he joked.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/jay-chou-interview-sothebys/index.html"}, {"title": "Afro Latinx children's books are still too rare.

He has illustrated more than 30 books and has authored four, including \"Octopus Stew,\" about a boy named Ramsey who must save his grandmother from the gargantuan octopus shes cooking.\"Octopus Stew\" was inspired by the tall tales of Velasquezs father. Credit: Eric Velasquez/Courtesy of Holiday House PublishingMy family comes from a strong oral storytelling tradition; we would gather together to share and listen after nights of dinner and music, and so it was something that I wanted to be part of.My book \"Octopus Stew is essentially a tribute to that oral tradition. Whenever my dad would come over and cook for my friends and me, he would inevitably say, \"Did Eric tell you about the day I rescued him and his grandma from the giant octopus?\" Every single one of my friends knows that story because of him, and over the years, it just grew like a tall tale.Grandmothers are central to many of my stories. I can trace my own career back to the summers I spent sketching in my grandmothers living room in Spanish Harlem, surrounded by music.In \"Grandmas Records,\" Velasquez recalls the memories from his own childhood that made him understand that heroes arent just White. Credit: Eric Velasquez/Bloomsbury Childrens BooksThose summers inspired my book \"Grandmas Records,\" and also taught me the importance of having heroes who look like us. I remember marveling at the musicians who would visit when I was young, including Rafael Cortijo, the prime architect of Puerto Rican salsa. When he came by, my grandmother told me only to refer to him as \"maestro.\"\"That man is a genius,\" she said, \"and he deserves to be treated with respect.\"In school, when we learned that Beethoven was a musical genius, I remember thinking, \"I know a genius too! He loves rice with beans and roast pork, and he even entertains us with music after dinner.\" I didnt feel there was a disconnect between the concept of \"genius\" and what I saw around me.But over time, I realized other kids struggled to do the same; at art school, when they pictured \"heroes\" they would never draw men or women of color.Thats when I started to realize how important representation is. When you grow up with examples of diverse heroes, it affects your imagination. You start to believe that you can be part of this creative world, and I think thats very important.Yesenia MoisesYesenia Moises is an Afro Dominican toy designer and illustrator. She is the author of \"Stellas Stellar Hair,\" a book about a young Black girl with natural hair who travels the solar system in search of hairstyles.\"Stellas Stella Hair\" is about owning your natural hair, inspired by Moises own hair journey. Credit: Yesenia MoisesWhen it comes to my hair, I spent most of my life trying to fit the mold of Eurocentric beauty standards by chemically relaxing my hair. Growing up, my mom, a fair-skinned Latina woman with the loose waves a lot of people aim for -- not at all like mine -- would always comment on how thick or unruly it is, or how it tangles itself.It was only after I started letting my hair grow out in its full, natural glory that I grew to love it, but even then I realized that many kids today are still made to feel bad about their hair. So I created \"Stellas Stellar Hair\" to celebrate the variety and creativity of Black hair across the African diaspora.Stella is aided on her intergalatic quest by cosmic aunties, who each have a hairstyle for her. Credit: Yesenia MoisesThe whole concept of having aunties from the different planets came from one Black hair trade show I attended, which was full of older Black women with amazing natural hairstyles that showed their personalities. And Id never seen that before. I was so used to making sure that my hair was as flat as possible, but here were all these older women who were just proud of the hair that grew out of their scalp. It really inspired me to show just how versatile and beautiful Black hair can be.I think its really important for young readers to feel seen more than anything else. As a dark-skinned Afro Latina, it wasnt until 2018, when I saw Miles Morales become Spider-Man in \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\" that I saw someone with my background represented in the media I watch. I really loved how the director made a choice to exclude English subtitles for the conversations Miles had with his mother. When you add subtitles, it makes the experience feel foreign; but in their household, it was natural -- just like it is in mine. That really floored me.Margarita EngleMargarita Engle is a poet and author whose works celebrate her Cuban heritage. Her book \"Drum Dream Girl,\" illustrated by Rafael López, is inspired by the true story of a young Chinese Afro Cuban girl who became a drummer for Cubas first all-female jazz band.\"Drum Dream Girl,\" written by Engle and illustrated by Rafael López, tells the journey of a girl in Cuba who pursues her love of drums. Credit: Margarita Engle/Clarion BooksI was born and raised in Los Angeles, but developed a deep attachment to Cuba, where my mother is from. We would go back in the summers to visit the extended family, but we were cut off from them because of travel restrictions after the missile crisis. When I was finally able to go back as an adult in 1991, I found that I wanted to write about the experience.I know that, all of a sudden, were not supposed to hyphenate things anymore in our writing. But I felt like I lived on that hyphen, and the compound word \"Cuban-American.\" It was a bridge and an abyss at the same time; by the time I was a teenager, it felt like it was easier for a US citizen to walk on the moon than to visit relatives in Cuba.Music is a recurring theme in my books. My picture book \"Drum Dream Girl\" is based on the life of Chinese Afro Cuban girl Millo Castro Zaldarriaga, who played the drums in Cuba when it was forbidden to girls.The story is a real tale of perserverence in a dreamlike setting. Credit: Margarita Engle/Clarion BooksI read the memoirs of her older sister and there were these amazing photographs of this all-girl band -- the first of its kind. In the 1930s, most of the jazz bands had been men, and here was one made up entirely of sisters. And the youngest was a 10-year-old girl who wanted to play the drums.Even today, in certain cultural traditions that come from West African religion, women in Cuba have to fight for the right to play certain types of drums. But in Millos case, for entertainment, she really opened that door. The band became very successful, and everybody loved her drumming, so, after a while, many other women drummers followed.I was inspired by her courage and her perseverance. When I talk to children about that book, I ask the boys, How would you feel if society said you couldnt drive monster trucks, or only girls could motorcycle race? And all the boys immediately give up their right to be the only one to do something. They instinctively understand that this isnt fair.Charles EsperanzaCharles Esperanza is an Afro Puerto Rican illustrator and author whose new book, \"Boogie Boogie Yall,\" published this summer.

Credit: CG EsperanzaIm interested in telling stories and taking something about our culture -- as a Black and Latino person, and as a Bronx resident -- and de-stigmatizing it. What inspired \"Boogie Boogie, Yall\" was an awesome graffiti piece outside of the community center where I teach. I took a photo of it to show to my students; it turns out none of them has seen it before. I said, \"Yall dont really look around and take in all of the awesome things that are on the street.\"Ive asked my students what theyve heard about graffiti and a lot of the answers were recycled from decades ago: Its gang symbols; its vandalism. I wanted to give them another perspective about it; I pay homage to a lot of contemporary street artists in the book like \"Gully\" and \"Modus,\" who can be seen all over the Bronx and the rest of New York City. Theyve seen the book and have expressed excitement about it.Esperanza wrote and illustrated the book after a conversation with his students about noticing whats in front of the them on the streets of their home borough. Credit: CG EsperanzaI think kids need to be able to see themselves in the books that they read, and they need to be able to see themselves in the art they look at. As a teacher, I notice many of my Black and Brown students create White characters. Instead of preaching to them that they should use people of color, I show them examples of amazing Black characters, created by artists like Yesenia Moises, LeSean Thomas or Geneva Bowers to inspire them.I get a lot of inspiration just walking around the Bronx, and I definitely wanted to capture that. I love the borough for its grittiness and personality. We are known for our cultural contributions through hip-hop, but we have so much more in food, fashion, art and music thats waiting to be shared with the world. All of our communities -- old and new -- are adding their vibrant tag to the wall that is the Bronx.When I was first trying to get into the business. I heard some really wild things about why publishers wouldnt have a Black child as the protagonist. I remember one editor told me that for picture books, they would rather have an animal like a panda or something as a main character, because every kid could relate to that. I was blown away, realizing that the underrepresentation was intentional this whole time. So Im glad that we have so many artists now that are coming in and knocking down the door and doing awesome things.Each authors personal statement was edited for length and clarity by a member of the CNN Style team.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/afro-latinx-childrens-books-hyphenated/index.html"}, {"title": "How collecting sneakers became a multi-billion-dollar industry", "data_published": "2021-07-05T09:46:04Z", "content": "Written by Megan C. Hills, CNNIn 2009, Derek Morrison stood in an airport boutique and considered spending $960 on a pair of Louis Vuitton x Kanye West sneakers crafted from rose-tinted suede and caramel leather. He ultimately decided against it -- he couldnt justify the price and had too many suitcases.A little over a decade later, the shoes are being advertised online for $10,000 a pair.\"Ive regretted it ever since,\" said Morrison, who now works as European senior director for the sneaker resale platform, StockXReleased just months before West debuted his game-changing Nike x Yeezy line, the sneakers have become part of fashion history. \"They represented a convergence of sneakers, Kanye and high fashion that was controversial at the time, but such a pivotal moment in the industry,\" Morrison said, describing it as \"a breakthrough that paved the way for the modern era we see today.\"Kanye Wests Grammy-worn 2008 Yeezy prototype sneakers, which sold for $1.8m at Sothebys in April.

Then, earlier this year, another of Kanye Wests creations -- the prototype Nike x Yeezys he wore to the 2008 Grammys -- became historys most expensive sneakers after selling via a private sale for $1.8 million.Over the past five years, theres been an \"explosion\" in collectors spending big money on rare shoes, according to Caitlin Donovan, head of handbags, streetwear and sneakers at Christies auction house. Together with sneaker resale platform Stadium Goods, Donovan recently curated a sale focusing on Nikes Jordan line. The online auction, which concluded this week, featured almost 30 rare pairs, from Jordan prototypes and game-worn sneakers to early limited-edition samples. A pair of red and black salesman sample Air Jordan High 1s was the auctions most expensive single item, selling for $27,500.A pair of Nike Air Jordan 1/2 development samples carried an auction estimate of $120,000 to $160,000.

This figure is predicted to climb to nearly $30 billion by 2030, as growing numbers of collectors invest in limited edition \"deadstock\" items -- shoes that \"must be new and unworn,\" Morrison said -- with the aim of reselling or displaying them as prized possessions.Ligaya Salazar, curator of the London Design Museums new StockX-sponsored exhibition \"Sneakers Unboxed: Studio to Street,\" said that it is \"young people, largely from diverse inner-city neighborhoods\" who have \"made sneakers what they are today.\" These original sneaker aficionados continue to have a major impact on the industry today, she added.Sneakers on display at the London Design Museums exhibit \"Sneakers Unboxed.\" Credit: Courtesy Felix Speller/London Design MuseumSneaker culture is also deeply intertwined with sports culture -- especially following the launch of Michael Jordans 1985 Air Jordan sneakers, which Donovan called \"the first and most collectible sneaker.\"\"It was the iconic sneakers of the early Jordan era that slowly permeated mainstream and pop culture, creating a breed of new collectors: sneakerheads,\" she said.Collectors have diversified in the years since, with Donovan seeing a growing number of millennials, who \"are only just starting on their collecting journey,\" join the more \"serious and established collectors of sports history and fashion.\"Sneaker collector Ann Jacobe , who owns around 500 pairs (and insists that she wears even the most valuable ones), said she welcomes new interest from luxury investors and auction houses. The Filipina collector, who has \"lost count\" of how much money she has spent on sneakers, said it \"elevates the consciousness that shoes can be treated like art.\"Collector Ann Jacobe with some of the sneakers in her closet. Credit: Courtesy Ann Jacobe\"Its a great thing, as I hold sneakers in high regard much like a sculpture or a painting. And based on the prices of some pairs (at auction), it is definitely going that route,\" she said, adding she would consider bidding for sneakers at auction if they \"resonate with me and bring me joy.\"While some collectors treat sneakers purely as an investment, others like Jacobe dont simply want to own coveted pairs -- they want to own the stories and lifestyles behind them, Morrison said. \"People tend to devote themselves to values, or narratives, or themes that transcend individual brands,\" he said, adding that sneakers can \"make us feel connected to brands, people and cultural moments.\"Speaking about her buying habits, Jacobe said, \"Sometimes its how (a pair) make me swoon the first time I see them; sometimes its the story behind the sneakers and how it resonates with my values.\"If Air Jordans are among the most popular sneakers on the market, they also have one of the best-known stories . The result of a collaboration between Michael Jordan and Nike, the design famously flouted the NBAs \"51% rule\" that stated footwear had to be predominantly white. Jordan nonetheless wore a red and black pair during a preseason game, helping them transcend fashion to represent a cultural moment. Nike later capitalized on the controversy, reissuing the original Air Jordan 1s as the \"banned\" edition.Ann Jacobes sneaker collection, which she estimates consists of 500 pairs. Credit: Courtesy Ann JacobeClearly aware of sneakers cultural power, Nike has since collaborated with luxury fashion labels like Dior and Sacai, as well as non-sporting celebrities such as Travis Scott and somewhat unlikely brands like Ben & Jerrys. Others have followed suit, from Adidas Marvel Avengers-themed sneakers to Balenciagas appeal to gamers via a partnership with PlayStation.Touchstones of sneaker culture can be found throughout Jacobes 500-pair collection, including the Yeezy Boost 350 Turtle Doves (\"a classic from Kanye Wests rich sneaker story,\" she said) and the Nike Dunk SB Reese Forbes (from what she called the early-2000s \"craze\" for Nikes SB skate shoes). She spent nearly a year looking for a rare pair of Nike x Off-White sneakers from 2017, saying it was \"like a self-declared holiday when I unboxed them.\"The collector also seeks out shoes that pay homage to her home country. Her favorites include the Nike AF-1 Philippines, which feature the colors of the national flag, as well as a pair of Asics designed with Whang Od, the last traditional Filipina tattoo artist from the Kalinga tribe.\"(Its) so surreal finding and owning a pair that represents us and the community so well,\" she said.Changing attitudesNot all collectors are motivated by their love for sneakers, however. As with art and property, shoes can represent both an investment and a way for collectors to \"diversify their assets,\" said Donovan, of Christies auction house.\"Limited edition iterations of classic styles ... have always been the pinnacle of the luxury secondary collecting market,\" she said, adding: \"Collectors seek out these collaborative works -- often released in limited quantities on the primary market -- on the secondary market at premium prices.A visitor stands in front of a display at the London Design Museums exhibit \"Sneakers Unboxed.\" Credit: Courtesy Felix Speller/London Design MuseumResale sites such as StockX, which tracks sneakers real-time value and the latest sales like Wall Street stocks, has made it easier for collectors to treat rare, expensive sneakers like commodities. (The platform even checks for counterfeits at dedicated authentication centers).And getting hold of new limited-edition designs is, increasingly, big business. Collectors might once have queued up outside stores for the latest \"drop,\" but many of todays resellers instead turn to online \"botting\" -- using software that automatically buys up stock the moment a new collection goes online. For brands that would rather sell to sneakerheads than bots, its \"an eternal arms race,\" Morrison said.If savvy resellers pay their cards right, they could make tens of thousands of dollars flipping deadstock. StockX said that the Jordan 1 Retro High Dior collaboration was the most expensive sneaker release of 2020, selling for $2,000 but fetching $11,000 online via a Sothebys auction. Only 8,500 pairs of the sneakers were ever made -- and they were launched on Air Jordans 35th anniversary, making for a perfect trifecta of rarity, luxury collaboration and historic moment. Today, the highest bid for a pair on StockX is over $12,600\"There are many factors why some may be more expensive than others, including how rare it is, has it been worn by a celebrity or if it was a hyped collaboration,\" Morrison said. \"But in general, it comes down to supply and demand -- the fewer that are available, the more compelling or resonant the product is, and the more theyll cost to obtain.\"But regardless of whether collectors are buying for pleasure or profit, all are looking for sneakers that speak to the culture of their day, Morrison said. \"Theyre more than just something that goes on your feet -- theyre a canvas that serve as a means of self-expression, whether youre a collector or wearing them right out of the box.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/sneaker-market-high-value-auction/index.html"}, {"title": "Covid canceled weddings around the world.

Leaner friendship groups are another reason, Rees says, for our lingering appreciation for low-profile events. While the pandemic put a strain on most platonic relationships , it razed some friendship categories -- like acquaintances -- to the ground.\"Theres been a shrinkage in the last year of our social circle and our social groups,\" Rees said. \"And so, you know, do you really need to invite your mothers friend from tennis to your wedding?\"A model wears a unique piece from Happy Isles.

According to Lyst, grooms are no different, with insights reporting a 26% increase in searches for \"mens wedding skirts\" on their platform since last year. The retail search engine highlights the Emmy Award-winning sitcom \"Schitts Creek\" as a source of inspiration, in which fashion-obsessed character David Rose, played by Dan Lavy, sports a groom skirt for his special day.Rees remains unconvinced. \"I think its a very niche audience for a mens skirt,\" she said. \"But we are seeing a lot more attention being put into what men are wearing for their wedding day.\"Traditional looks are still receiving a twist, with grooms opting for regular suit cuts in daring colors. Pink may be the new black, reports Lyst, pointing to a 33% increase this year in the number of men looking at pink suits online.For the more understated grooms, jewelry is one fast becoming one low-fuss way to modernize an outfit. In May, luxury jewelers Tiffany & Co announced they would be selling mens engagement rings for the first time in their 184-year-history. When it comes to groom fashion, Rees agrees the devil is in the details. WGSN reports an uptick in groom-centric gift-giving, subverting the traditional bridal shower and lavishing the husband-to-be with presents like custom rings complete with engraving. Groom jewelry is on Lysts radar, too -- with platform searches for engagement watches jumping over 40% this year.Bold patterns and striking colors are set to dominate groom fashion in the coming years.

Now, Kaizer says, vintage pieces will become a mainstay in the wedding industry through 2021 and beyond. \"They just offer that special, unique thing thats completely guilt free.\"Reflecting on future ceremonies, there will still be some markers of where coronavirus once was, Rees says. \"There might be a little bit more space between tables, or maybe there is always hand sanitizer now in your goodie bag.\"Top image: a digital collage of upcoming 2021 wedding trends, courtesy of Lyst.Correction: An earlier version of this story included a photo caption that incorrectly identified a model for Happy Isles.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/covid-wedding-dress-code-trends/index.html"}, {"title": "Charlotte Perriand: The little-known 20th century designer who could see our homes of the future", "data_published": "2021-06-18T15:56:08Z", "content": "Written by Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN LondonThe story of the late Charlotte Perriand is an inspiring tale of an adventurous designer whose ideas and creations left a lasting mark on homes around the world. But most people will have never heard of the pioneering maker -- her place in history often overshadowed by her male contemporaries.Starting off as a young furniture designer in Paris in the late 1920s, Perriand was one of very few women in the field at a time when society was often unwelcoming to working women. Le Corbusier, a giant of modern architecture, famously dismissed her when she first turned up at his office in search of a job after completing her studies. \"We dont do embroidery here,\" he quipped condescendingly.A year later, Le Corbusier reneged on his snap judgement when he saw Perriands work on display at an annual fair for young artists, the Salon dAutomne, in 1929. Her installation, \"Bar sous le Toit\" (Bar in the Attic), a simple staging of modern, industrial-looking interior design, caught his eye and was her ticket to join his team.During her time with Le Corbusier and his clique of creatives, Perriand would become instrumental in the design of one of the most iconic pieces of Modernist furniture to date: the B306 tubular steel chaise longue, also known as the \"chaise lounge basculante\" for its tilted design. An example of this piece, still coveted by todays collectors of modernist design, is on display in a new retrospective of her work at Londons Design Museum. The exhibition follows a 2019 show about Perriand at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, and is one of the few celebrations of her work at such a scale.\"Chaise longue basculante\" (Adjustable reclining chair), 1928 (Cassina). Credit: Felix Speller/The Design MuseumBorn in 1903, she lived from the start to the end of the last century, passing away in October 1999. A great visionary, Perriand had a knack for dreaming up ways in which people would want to live in the future. Many of her creations feel particularly pertinent when viewed through todays lens.Better to spend the day out in the sun, than dusting your useless objects Charlotte PerriandIn a series of drawings titled \"Travail et Sport,\" (Work and Sport) published in interior design manual \"Répertoire du goût moderne\" in 1929, Perriand proposed a multifunctional space that could easily transform from a home to an office to a gym. She was solving a problem many of us would face more than 20 years after her death, as we sheltered in place during pandemic-related lockdowns, but at the time she was simply thinking about modern living.Lead curator of the Design Museum show, Justin McGuirk, said Perriand understood that the future would call for more houses -- and more affordable housing at that. She was thinking about how to \"take people out of poor-quality or slum housing, even in places like Paris,\" he explained during a phone interview, \"and she (knew) that there was not going to be unlimited amounts of space for these people, that apartments might have to be small, and they have to be multifunctional.\"\"Travail et Sport\" (Work and Sport) model, 1927, byCharlotte Perriand (Archives Charlotte Perriand). Credit: Felix Speller/The Design MuseumThis desire to create good living spaces is one of the defining pillars of Perriands work. According to Esme Hawes, assistant curator at the Design Museum, the appreciation that design is about providing a service to people was a recurring theme of Perriands practice.\"A lot of her design is really focused around making things accessible and improving peoples lives, and their quality of life, through design,\" Hawes said in an interview at the exhibition, \"and I think thats something that a lot of female designers do.\" Noting that women in design often have to work harder to establish themselves, Hawes suggested \"they feel they really have to use their platform\" once they earn it.Charlotte Perriand with Le Corbusier holding a plate like a halo in the background, 1928 Credit: ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2021 / © AChPPerriand did just that. Over the course of her decades-long career she designed furniture, student accommodation, military quarters, private homes, offices and even a 1960s ski resort, in Les Arcs, France, which is still in use today.Perriand parted ways with Le Corbusier after about eight years (some believe their disparate political beliefs caused their relationship to break down -- she was a steadfast communist, while her boss was apparently more sympathetic with the far right -- others figure she wanted to step out from behind Le Corbusier).In 1940, Perriand received a then-extraordinary invitation to travel to Japan to work with the Department of Trade Promotion to help enhance Japanese products and increase sales to the West. While her role mostly saw her consulting and guiding local designers and artisans, she was deeply influenced by the two years she spent in the country -- most notably in the materials she used.Les Arcs ski resort in France, 1967-69. Credit: © ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2021 / © AChPAccording to McGuirk, Perriand had previously been dogmatic in her use of metal and modern materials that were seen as the \"language of the future, the language of the Machine Age.\" But in Japan, she became \"hugely impressed by the quality of (Japanese) craftsmanship,\" he said, explaining that she introduced materials like bamboo into her work, and eventually found \"an interesting compromise between two contrasting worlds.\"She also became enthralled by Japanese homes and their clever use of space, which underscored her belief in what McGuirk described as \"flexible emptiness\" -- the idea that you can live well without lots of furniture, as long as they are highly functional pieces. \"Better to spend the day out in the sun, than dusting your useless objects,\" she wrote in the book \"Lart dhabiter,\" published in 1950.Perriand was informed by the belief that women should not spend hours at home doing housework. A keen sportswoman and traveler, she would have had little time for domestic duties herself.While Perriand was finding compromises, the rest of the world was still at war. Tensions between France and Japan, an ally of Germany, were heating up, and Perriand, while trying to get back to Paris via the United States, ended up in French Indochina (now Vietnam), where she spent several years until the end of the war.Once back in France, she solidified another quality she is often remembered for: her ability to collaborate and synthesize. She continued to design with Jean Prouvé , another important figure in French modernist and prefabricated design, who she had begun working with before the war. The Design Museum exhibition also notes her close link to artist Ferdinand Léger (a number of his artworks hang in the space around her furniture). Ironically, despite her openness to collaborate and the impression she made on the men she worked with, many of their names remain better-known than hers. But those who know her work have no issue explaining just how influential she was.Bookcase for the Maisondu Mexique students room, 1952. Credit: Felix Speller/The Design MuseumThe easiest way to understand Perriands work -- and to put it into context of today -- is to look at a very simple design concept: storage. As the exhibition catalog notes, it might seem banal to focus on storage, but her many cabinets and shelves are a tribute to her ethos: practical, modern, multifunctional and essential to everyday living. She often used large, modular shelving units to divide rooms, a very familiar interior design trick still used in homes and offices today. And echoes of her designs are everywhere -- just walk through Ikea for proof.The last object on display at the Design Museum show is a very simple piece made by an unknown designer that she purchased in Brazil in the 1960s. Its a green plastic soda bottle that has been transformed into a simple decorative vase. Her attraction to the piece, and the fact that she kept it, speaks volumes about her design values, as summarized by a label on the exhibition wall: \"resourceful, intelligent and infused with humanity.\"\"Charlotte Perriand: The Modern Life\" is on at the Design Museum in London June 19 - September 5.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/charlotte-perriand-design-museum/index.html"}, {"title": "The Futura is now: Pioneering New York street artist is finally getting his dues", "data_published": "2021-06-10T13:06:41Z", "content": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN Hong KongIn the early 1980s, Leonard McGurrs name was often uttered in the same breath as those of his artist friends Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring.

I was a token in their world,\" McGurr says of the institutions he felt were pigeonholing his work. \"Yeah, I was showing in a gallery with Jean-Michel, Keith, Kenny (Scharf) and other contemporary artists. But then there I was -- the the subway guy -- and Im there thinking, The gallery is using me.\"A work by Futura on display at a Monaco exhibition about the history of street art in 2011. Credit: Patrick Aventurier/Getty ImagesIn the decades that followed, he moved beyond walls, canvases and aerosols, finding new mediums for an aesthetic that nods to particle physics and the space age. With two children to support, McGurr shunned exhibitions in favor of graphic design and, later, edgy brand collaborations with the likes of Comme des Garçons and Nike.His spacey atoms and rocket ships -- signature forms often set against hazy, colorful blotches of spray paint -- have since found their way onto sneakers, streetwear and even bottles of Hennessey cognac\"In the end, I found other things to do,\" he says. \"I got into clothing, I got into other means of expression, I found the internet in the 1990s. I just tried things other than being a classic artist, represented by XYZ gallery in Asia and North America -- you know, the classic cookie cutter stuff.\"Collectibles on display at Futuras new pop-up shop in Hong Kong. Credit: CourtesyNone of this is to say that McGurr hasnt been successful -- far from it. After all, it would be unfair to measure anyones accomplishments against those of his most idolized contemporaries. (\"Jean-Michel was the golden child,\" McGurr notes fondly of his late friend. \"He was the chosen one.\")But now, aged 65, the New Yorker is finally getting his dues.Known simply as Futura (the new millennium rendered \"2000\" an anachronism), McGurr is arguably more relevant than ever. Having long embraced the kind of collaborations that have become de rigueur for todays contemporary artists, he finds himself perfectly placed to capitalize on his decades-long experience.McGurr may be old enough to have fathered two millennials, but he also epitomizes the zeitgeist of new, younger generations of art collectors. He is currently collaborating with Italian bikemaker Cinelli , and has recently designed a special edition BMW and a line of Uniqlo activewear bearing paint streaks and atom graphics. He has also just finished filming a MasterClass, the celebrity-led online learning platform reserved for industries biggest names, from Gordon Ramsay to Samuel L. Jackson (\"I guess Ill be teaching kids how to spray paint,\" he muses).\"I feel Ive been very patient, but Im getting mine now,\" he says.A new abstractionWhen it comes to limited edition collectibles, a lucrative industry for contemporary art heavyweights like Yayoi Kusama and KAWS, McGurr is an old hand, too.We meet in the labyrinthine basement of Hong Kongs upscale Landmark mall, where McGurrs \"Futuraland\" sculptures, mobiles and streetwear are available via a pop-up store that counts Dior and Gucci as neighbors.

Credit: Courtesy BelowgroundTrue to his name, Futura is unrelentingly forward-facing. Fresh out of Hong Kongs mandatory two-week Covid-19 hotel quarantine, he has already moved on from the ordeal. \"Once I walked out of there yesterday morning, from my point of view, it never happened,\" he says. \"Its like I just arrived from the airport.\"\"I look at my life that way too. I dont live in the rear-view mirror. I dont want to come telling you about everything I did. Who cares, its irrelevant.\"Having just declared the pasts irrelevance, McGurr gamely entertains my questions about his early career. (\"I certainly dont ever mind taking about it,\" he clarifies. \"And I have a great memory and know exactly what happened.\")After breaking onto New Yorks underground graffiti scene in the 70s, it was his 1980 \"Break\" mural that earned McGurr wider recognition. Bringing an entire subway car to life in brooding shades of orange, he centered the work on an abstract patch of striking blue and purple that seemed to shine out through imagined cracks.It was perhaps little surprise that New York, the city responsible for Abstract Expressionism, might also produce a style of nonfigurative street art that eschewed bold lettering and cartoonish forms. But, McGurr says, \"it wasnt premeditated.\"A work by Futura on dsiplay at an exhibition in Calais, northern France. Credit: Denis Charlet/AFP/Getty Images\"I didnt really know much about art,\" he says, \"I didnt know De Kooning, I didnt know Rothko ... I couldnt name you anybody that was an abstract painter. I knew Warhol , Lichtenstein and Rauschenberg. I knew about American art but I wasnt really into it.\"\"People were comparing me to Kandinsky,\" he adds, \"But it was kind of an accident what I did.\"Revisiting an eraAccidental or not, McGurr may now be benefiting from revived interest in the street scene he emerged from. With Basquiat the undisputed star of New Yorks recent spring auctions (his 1983 painting \"In This Case\" sold at Christies for $93.1 million), there appears to be growing institutional intrigue about an era directly responsible for many of todays art stars, from Banksy and JR to Shepard Fairey and Osgemeos\"The story that we were telling, way prematurely to its acceptance, is all coming back,\" McGurr says. \"And all the contemporary artists of the moment are out there keeping it going, and transitioning from the street to commercial galleries and institutions or whatever their path is.\"Items from the Futuras 2014 collaboration with streetwear label Crooks & Castles. Credit: Noel Vasquez/Getty Images North AmericaFitting, perhaps, that McGurr is also dipping his toe back into the institutional waters. In 2020 he exhibited a series of paintings at gallerist Eric Firestones New York space (a show dubbed \"Futura 2020\"). And despite Covid-related postponements, he hopes to open a show at Takashi Murakamis Tokyo gallery later this year.Overcoming his misgivings about the art establishment is both about \"being in control of production and publication\" and finding -- in Firestone and Hong Kongs AllRightsReserved -- representatives he trusts.\"I have too many options to let myself get manipulated now,\" McGurr says.Futura pictured during the press launch of \"Futuraland\" in Hong Kong. Credit: Courtesy BelowgroundNonetheless, his reasons for reconnecting with the art mainstream still closely resemble his reasons for rejecting it in the first place: For Futura, the idea of legacy appears closely tied to the wellbeing of his family.\"Prior to Keith (Harings) passing, he laid out a bunch of artworks for all these kids -- my son got three or four pieces,\" he recalls. \"I thought Wow, dude, how benevolent and generous of you. You know youre going to die, and youre taking care of other people and children? So, I was super inspired by that.\"For the moment, Im preparing for my guys, putting away work and archiving stuff. My digital IP will live in perpetuity. You know at some point my family, whether 100 years from now or in 2050, will be able to use that.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/futura-street-artist/index.html"}, {"title": "$1B feud involving Leonardo's 'Salvator Mundi' reveals dark side of the art world", "data_published": "2021-05-30T07:12:11Z", "content": "Written by Nina dos Santos, CNN Contributors Lauren Kent, CNNIt is the biggest legal fight the art world has ever witnessed: a Russian oligarch, who claims he was ripped off buying multi-million-dollar masterpieces, versus a Swiss art dealer who says it was just business.Now, after six years of lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions, the tables appear to be turning once more in a saga so dramatic its been given a name worthy of a movie script: \"The Bouvier Affair.\"Russian fertilizer tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev has pursued Swiss art dealer and freeport storage magnate Yves Bouvier around the world for years in various courts, claiming to have been swindled out of $1 billion on 38 exorbitantly priced artworks sold to him by Bouvier over the course of a decade.But in a new twist, Bouvier has told CNN he is preparing his own billion-dollar damage counter suit against Rybolovlev, after taking legal action in Singapore in February, alleging a long-running court battle with Rybolovlev has ruined his businesses and reputation.The cases so far have kept an army of lawyers and reputation managers employed on either side, as one allegation against another is levied by each party, including claims of intimidation and political intrigue.Fittingly, the tortuous imbroglio also involves some of the most priceless and controversial pieces of art, including the 2013 purchase of what is now the worlds most expensive and enigmatic painting: the \"Salvator Mundi,\" thought by some to be the work of Leonardo da Vinci despite years of debate over its authenticity -- a work on which Bouvier made a markup of more than 50%.The \"Salvator Mundi\" on display at a press preview at Christies in New York in 2017. Credit: Dennis Van Tine/Sipa USA/APLong believed by others to be a copy or the work of Leonardos studio, the \"Salvator Mundi\" was purchased in 2005 by a consortium of speculative art dealers for under $10,000. Eight years later, after the painting had been restored and declared the work of the Renaissance master, Bouvier bought it for $80 million after enlisting the help of a poker player to beat down the price. The dealer swiftly sold it on for $127.5 million to his then-client, Rybolovlev, via the pairs offshore vehicles, according to an invoice referred to in court papers, and taking a 1% commission. And while the oligarch later auctioned off the painting for an astonishing $450 million in 2017 , to a secret buyer now widely believed to be Saudi Arabias Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he nonetheless alleges that Bouvier defrauded him -- a claim Bouvier denies.Rybolovlev declined to be interviewed for this story, but a spokesperson for Dmitry Rybolovlevs family entities told CNN: \"These matters are being fought in the courts where we expect to prove what happened and that Bouviers fanciful story is false. For now, what is most notable is what Bouvier does not dispute: as an art adviser, he pretended to help his clients assemble an art collection at a cost of $2 billion while secretly reaping half of that price for himself.\"Yet Bouvier does dispute he was ever an \"art adviser,\" a matter that has at been at the heart of the litigation and allegations by Rybolovlev of breach of trust.\"I am an art dealer,\" he told CNN. \"The contracts prepared by Rybolovlevs lawyers and all my invoices explicitly described me as the seller.\"Rybolovlev has never managed to convince a single judge or prosecutor otherwise, in any jurisdiction, for the very simple reason that his allegations do not match the reality of our contractual relations.\"The saga of the legal battle encompasses many of the problems regulators have identified with the soaring global art market -- art, in the wrong hands, has become yet another commodity to move money with little accountability.Related video: Why is art so expensive?The \"Salvator Mundi,\" meanwhile, hasnt been seen since the record-breaking sale. But it has been back in the headlines after a French documentary claimed in April that the painting had been at the center of a diplomatic spat between Paris and Riyadh, amid doubts over its authenticity and a request by the kingdom that it be shown in the Louvre.CNN reached out to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for comment but is yet to receive a response.In the documentary, \"The Savior for Sale,\" an anonymous high-ranking French official claims that Prince bin Salman was adamant that the \"Salvator Mundi\" be displayed next to the \"Mona Lisa\" in order to solidify its place as an authentic Leonardo -- despite ongoing questions about whether the work is entirely by the Italian master.The French government ultimately decided not to exhibit the painting under the Saudis conditions, which the anonymous official says in the film \"would be akin to laundering a piece that cost $450 million.\" Even with the painting out of the public eye, art historians and experts have continued to debate whether the \"Salvator Mundi\" is an autograph Leonardo or whether he merely contributed to a painting that was predominantly executed by his workshop. The difference could affect its value by hundreds of millions of dollars, given that there are fewer than 20 authenticated Leonardo paintings in the world.A true Leonardo?It seems that even those seeking to profit from the painting had doubts about its authenticity.Emails shared with CNN by Bouvier appear to show communication between Bouvier and a representative of Rybolovlev in which the dealer advised his client in 2013 that the work was a thing of beauty but not a good investment. It was so heavily restored, the dealer wrote, that experts doubted the work was entirely completed by Leonardo himself, and neither the Vatican nor any major world museum had expressed interest in acquiring it.Christies employees take bids for Leonardo da Vincis \"Salvator Mundi\" at the Christies auction in New York in November 2017. Credit: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\"The hands are the best-preserved bits,\" reads Bouviers email, dated March 22, 2013, while \"the rest of it has largely been restored.\"In another email, Bouvier writes that any \"buyer who acquires this painting that no one wants at too high a price will be seen as a pigeon and become the laughing stock of the market and will lose credibility,\" given the \"very low original proportion that appears to have been painted by the hand of Leonardo himself.\"Bouvier nonetheless arranged to borrow the \"Salvator Mundi\" (with a $63 million deposit, he said) from Sothebys. He claims he then arranged for it to be delivered to the Russians penthouse in Manhattan in a \"black document holder.\"Antoine Vitkine, the filmmaker who spent two years producing the recent documentary, told CNN he was taken aback to learn that Bouvier, who began his career as an art world outsider, was among those to cast doubt on the paintings credentials given that more prominent experts have authenticated the \"Salvator Mundi.\"\"Thats extraordinary,\" Vitkine said, adding that he thinks some prominent art historians who have risked their reputation on the \"Salvator Mundi\" were more lax than they would normally be when it comes to weighing in on a rediscovered painting.Among those to throw their weight behind the attribution to Leonardo was the UKs National Gallery, which exhibited the \"Salvator Mundi\" in 2011 and catapulted it into the global spotlight. The paintings unveiling was, at the time, widely covered by the press, including CNN.\"You have to remember, so many people have a stake in this work,\" Vitkine said.sA view from outside of the Leonardo da Vinci exhibit at the National Gallery in 2011 in London Credit: George Rose/Getty ImagesA bitter back and forthBouvier has always denied the charges of fraud leveled against him by Rybolovlev, who has seen his own share of tabloid controversy, including a headline-grabbing divorce and the purchase of an eye-wateringly expensive property from Donald Trump years before the former president took office.The Russian oligarch, who is president and co-owner of AS Monaco Football Club, is fighting charges in relation to a bribery scandal of Monegasque officials in connection with the Bouvier litigation, in a case dubbed \"Monacogate\" by the French-language press.Lawyers for Rybolovlev said in a statement \"As far as these allegations are concerned, Dmitriy Rybolovlev remains presumed innocent. He is completely confident about the outcome of this case, in which, after more than three and a half years of investigation, no convincing evidence against him could be found.\"Yves Bouvier Credit: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn the last six years, Bouvier has fended off legal action in Monaco, Singapore and Hong Kong. A $380 million suit, launched by Rybolovlev against Sothebys for allegedly helping Bouvier inflate his prices is still ongoing in New York. That litigation sprang back into the public domain on May 7, when Rybolovlevs legal team amended their complaint for the first time in two years to include the sale of a Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec painting on behalf of Rybolovlev by Sothebys via Bouvier, claiming it was hard to recoup the price paid on the work because of its inflated value. Rybolovlev also claimed in the amended complaint he was not paid the $9.5 million the auction house owed him over the sale. Sothebys is contesting the claim.The onslaught of litigation has, according to Bouvier, turned his life upside down. \"I used to be an entrepreneur, someone with many businesses and a family firm built up over 50 years,\" he told CNN.\"Since all this started, all Ive done is spent my time defending myself in court and my reputation in the press,\" said Bouvier, who admits he made $40 million by flipping the \"Salvator Mundi\" in two days.Text messages presented in the French documentary -- not independently confirmed by CNN -- appear to show Bouvier claiming to Rybolovlevs aides that he couldnt secure him a better price than the amount the Russian eventually paid.\"Thats a very good deal for my company. Im not going to complain,\" said Bouvier when asked about the large difference.\"You have to understand what this was like,\" said Bouvier. \"I was blacklisted by the auction houses, the banks wouldnt extend credit (to me, and) I had to start selling off assets to keep my staff and my businesses.\"Dmitry Rybolovlev Credit: Patrick Kovarik/AFP/Getty ImagesBouvier claims he has been spied upon and followed by various individuals he does not know. Via a representative of his own he shared with CNN an 81-page private investigation he appears to have shared with prosecutors in Geneva, codenamed \"Buldog\" which he had commissioned from a Swiss security firm named 4CTM. Beyond concluding he had been tailed by a group of men the firm believed to be British as part of a \"very big budget operation,\" the report was not able to further identify the people allegedly tailing Bouvier. Asked by CNN about the alleged surveillance, Rybolovlevs representative had no comment.CNN reached out to 4CTM security for comment on their report but is yet to receive a response.Exploiting the art worlds opacityTo author and filmmaker Ben Lewis, whose 2019 book \"The Last Leonardo\" details the drama surrounding the \"Salvator Mundi,\" the public fight between Bouvier and Rybolovlev lifts the veil on the art markets ugly side.\"The Bouvier Affair is a classic example of what can go wrong in the secretive, opaque, and -- in inverted commas -- discreet art market,\" said Lewis during an interview with CNN in London, who notes that parts of the art world have developed a rocky reputation for its way of doing business.\"Opacity, lack of transparency, greed, tax evasion, money laundering, art historical dishonesty, dissembling, disingenuousness, corruption. I mean, where does it end?\"But the secrecy, hefty markups, and legal contention involved in the \"Salvator Mundi\" scandal are not representative of the vast majority of art transactions, says art collector and expert Kenny Schachter.\"The fact that people always say the art world is so unregulated and has a dark side is a bit of an exaggeration,\" said Schachter, in a phone interview with CNN, adding that art isnt any more corrupt than other industries involving multi-million-dollar deals, such as real estate, jewelry, and banking. \"No matter what it is, when there is a lot of money, there is going to be bad actions.\"But when it comes to secrecy that does exist in certain facets of the art world, Bouvier is not only a conduit for valuable artworks -- he has built a career on helping the rich keep valuable works hidden from view. As well as having been a major investor in the Geneva freeport, a huge, high-security storage facility where collectors and galleries hold artworks in tax-efficient warehouses, the Swiss dealer has helped establish new freeports in Luxembourg and Singapore.Bouvier told CNN that Russia also expressed interest in having its own tax-exempt freeport.In 2016, a year into his legal woes, Bouvier said he was approached by Yury Trutnev, Russias deputy prime minister and a personal friend of Rybolovlev, with a proposal to help build one in Vladivostok, at the behest of President Vladimir Putin. A photograph, shared with CNN by Bouvier, appears to show Bouvier and Trutnev meeting in Singapore. The Swiss dealer also shared various emails, which CNN was unable to independently verify, seemingly showing Russian officials inviting him to join the project.The Russian freeport ultimately never went ahead. But Bouvier claims that he asked Russias deputy prime minister to intervene in his dispute with Rybolovlev in return for his help on the project.\"I did mention (to Trutnev), I have some legal issues with one of your fellow citizens,\" Bouvier said. \"He told me, Ill take care of it. That was when I understood: The message was If you help me sort this problem out, Ill make yours go away.\"CNN reached out to the Russian government and Trutnevs office for comment but is yet to receive a response.\"I might do business with Russia in the future -- why not? Its a country of great culture but Id never do business with an oligarch again,\" Bouvier said.Russias Kremlin-connected elite is already under scrutiny over its art holdings: A report published by the US Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 2020 claimed companies linked to two other Russian oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin had exploited the art worlds opacity to evade sanctions.The findings prompted Senators to call for greater transparency in the fine art sector.\"It is shocking that US banking regulations dont currently apply to multimillion-dollar art transactions, and we cannot let that continue,\" Ohio Senator Rob Portman, the committees chairman, said in a statement at the time.Related video: How do art auctions really work?Art masterpieces often pack high dollar value into a small, portable canvas, Lewis says. \"Fifty million bucks in a suitcase, right? And whos to say how much its really worth?\"The European Union and UK have also bolstered regulations on art sales with anti-money laundering legislation adopted in 2020. Those regulations require auctions houses and art dealers to do due diligence on new customers for any transaction that exceeds about $12,000.\"Theres been a steady increase in compliance regulations,\" Schachter said. \"Its a big misperception for people to think that the art world is just this cesspool... maybe it was more like that in the past, but theres definitely been a clamping down.\"Schachter also notes that storing art in freeports is relatively common and usually done for legitimate reasons, such as not having enough wall space for a vast art collection.\"A real collector is someone who is not really hindered by the lack of space to hang something or the lack of money to buy something because collectors just have to have it and theyll always figure out a way -- sometimes illicitly, but mostly not,\" he said. \"I dont think everyone in the art world are angels, but I dont think that (freeports) are purpose-built for evasion or money laundering.\"Still MIAAgainst the backdrop of legal wrangling, there is one question on the lips of everyone in the art world: Where is the \"Salvator Mundi\"?Bouvier doubts recent reports that its on Prince bin Salmans yacht, as was alleged in 2019.\"To put a painting like this on a yacht, with the sea air and the evaporation would be utterly stupid. I cannot believe the buyer would put this painting in a setting like that,\" Bouvier said.\"It is on a wood board, which can warp in no time,\" he said, referring to the walnut panel on which the artwork was painted.Vitkine speculates that \"it might be that we see it one day in the Louvre Abu Dhab i. Who knows?\"Meanwhile, Lewis thinks it could be in a palace in Saudi Arabia, ready to be unveiled -- perhaps before the end of this year -- as part of the kingdoms drive to brand itself as a hub for arts and culture. \"The important thing about the art market is that behind the most beautiful objects often lie the ugliest of motives,\" he said. \"Salvator Mundi means Savior of the world. And in a way, the painting is now not so much Savior of the world, as the Savior of Saudi Arabia.\"Meanwhile, with the legal wrangling between the paintings former owners resurfacing once more, this valuable masterpiece and others once in the same collection, continue to test many a reputation.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/salvator-mundi-scandal-bouvier-rybolovlev-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "These architects believe communal living is the way of the future", "data_published": "2021-05-27T22:24:50Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNPicture a sunlit modern interior built from light wood, where private apartments open up into airy communal spaces. Residents organize their social activities and hobbies in groups, connecting over shared interests. They meet regularly to vote on community rules. If you are elderly or a new parent -- or simply lonely -- there is always someone around for support.This way of living may sound like an impossible utopia, but some are already experiencing its potential. \"What We Share. A model for cohousing\" is a concept for a housing project designed by founding architects Siv Helene Stangeland and Reinhard Kropf of Norweigian firm Helen & Hard. Currently on display as a walkable installation curated by the National Museum of Norway at the 17th Venice Architecture Biennale, the prototype invites visitors to consider giving up traditional residences to reduce their carbon emissions and improve social well-being.The installation \"What We Share\" is currently on display at the Venice Architecture Biennale. Credit: Chiara Masiero Sgrinzatto/Luca Nicolò Vascon/National Museum of Norway/Courtesy of Helen & HardThe model is not just a lofty idea that the architects are asking people to try, untested. It is based on the 40-unit cohousing project Vindmøllebakken, located in Stavanger, Norway, which they completed in 2019 and now call their home. They also have five similar buildings in the works.\"What We Share\" presents an updated take on communal living that differs from both the hippie communes of the 1960s and 70s -- where members managed a plot of land and pooled their income -- and the more recent slew of so-called \"adult dorms\" cropping up in major cities like San Francisco, New York and London -- where residents rent sleek, furnished rooms and share common areas and amenities. Instead, Stangeland and Kropfs model is based on the Danish cohousing tradition, in which residents own their private homes but share communal areas that suit their needs. In \"What We Share,\" however, they take ownership a step further, with each member having a stake in the common spaces, too.The installation is a 1:1-scale cross-section of a cohousing model, encouraging visitors to explore and imagine what life would be like there. Credit: DSL Studio/Courtesy of Helen & Hard\"Most cohousing projects we know of in Scandinavia, they maybe have a common space, but this is not owned,\" said Kropf in a joint video call with Stangeland. \"You get those architectural benefits by having this beautiful, generous common space, which (many) cant afford.\"Located in the Nordic pavilion at the Biennale, the installation features a cross-section of what the actual layout would look like, down to the furniture and homewares. \"(It) feels like stepping into something which is a home, but a new kind of home,\" Stangeland said. \"We wanted the installation to trigger curiosity so that people think about...how architecture can help us live in another way together, and how it can facilitate a more communal life.\"\"What We Share\" takes an even more radical approach to co-living than Vindmøllebakken, where there are shared spaces like kitchens, guestrooms and a library, as well as more flexible areas for work or leisure, but the delineation between private and public life is more pronounced. For the new concept, they posed a question to their current neighbors: Which functions or social situations could they move out of their apartments and share with other residents?The Venice presentation is based on a real cohousing project that the architects completed in 2019; its where they now reside with 39 other families and residents. Credit: Minna Soujoki langbord/Courtesy of Helen & HardThe answer to that led to the design of a \"sharing layer\" between the compact private rooms and the open central space -- flexible areas that are separated from the central common one, which can be used for small social or solo activities. Kropf calls them \"a buffer zone mediating between the very private space and the common space.\"The layout itself is also modifiable. The interior is built from spruce wood planks and beech dowels, which means that residents can reassemble walls, dividers, counters, storage and furniture as needed to transform the space.An alternative solutionCo-living may provide an answer to the pressing climate and population concerns that we face across the globe. Stangeland and Kropf say that residents of Vindmøllebakken significantly reduce their carbon footprint by requiring less space and sharing appliances like washing machines. The use of locally sourced timber for the existing project, as well as the proposed one, is around 70% more sustainable than steel and concrete, according to the architects estimates.Cohousing also provides an alternative to nursing homes at a time when aging populations are set to overtake younger ones. Last July, a study published in The Lancet estimated that the worlds population was likely to enter a sustained decline in the second half of this century. Its already happening in countries like Japan, where the birth rate has been steadily decreasingAt Vindmøllebakken, residents own their compact apartments as well as co-own the ample common space. Credit: Sindre Ellingsen/Courtesy of Helen & HardThe architects also want to explore how well-designed spaces can be a balm for loneliness -- a widespread problem in the US, where more than a third of adults age 45 and older say they feel lonely, according to the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine . Loneliness is even becoming endemic in one of the \" happiest \" countries, Sweden, where most households are people who live alone. Loneliness can have stark health impacts that substantially increase a persons risk of early death, and after a year of extreme social isolation due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the need to connect with others is becoming an increasingly urgent health matter.\"I think people are becoming much more aware of how important light is, and balconies, but also the neighborhood and the surroundings that you have access to, to gardens or spaces outside your dwelling,\" Stangeland said. She added that at Vindmøllebakken during the pandemic, they have \"been able to keep on with social meetings and activities, although we have new restrictions, because they are organized and coordinated.\" That has meant breaking off into small groups or using their 5,300-square-foot common space for distanced events, like outdoor concerts that can be enjoyed from residents balconies.Sharing valuesWhile the concept of co-living is as old as early hunter-gatherer societies, modern co-living has taken on a few distinct forms, including Berlins \"baugruppen,\" or \"building group,\" movement -- which brings people together to cofinance building blocks with government support -- and Silicon Valleys \"hacker homes,\" where engineers live and work together. Some mid-century European co-living projects were designed to make it easier for women to enter the workforce. And hippies across the Western world used communal living models as a way to eschew the nuclear family structure.Co-living has also become an alternative in cities with steeper rental prices where young people are flocking for work, and US companies like Starcity and Common, Chinas You+, and the UKs The Collective have seized upon the trend. They each offer fully furnished private quarters with pristine-looking common areas, along with a slew of amenities, functioning almost like long-term hostels.In addition to Vindmøllebakken, Helen & Hard have five other cohousing projects in the works. Credit: Sindre Ellingsen/Courtesy of Helen & HardFor their own designs, Stangeland and Kropf looked to several cohousing projects for inspiration, including Sargfabrik in Austria, Lange Eng in Denmark, and Kraftwerk 2 in Switzerland, which cater to residents of all ages.What all co-living initiatives seem to share is the desire to create community, whether based on ideological beliefs or simply to make friends or network. But for Stangeland and Kropf, that means building eco-conscious spaces for multigenerational inhabitants who act as a small village, volunteering their time to ensure their shared home thrives. They believe co-owning the property, instead of renting, helps to strengthen those bonds. At Vindmøllebakken, they say prices are about on par with the average home in the area, and they believe such a community can attract first-time buyers to the housing market.\"If you have a rental apartment it is more difficult to build...a long-lasting community,\" Kropf said. \"We think that by empowering the inhabitants (as) shareholders and participants, you have more open processes and its more democratic and transparent.\"This is a rich lifeAt Vindmøllebakken, residents have organized 26 different groups, according to Kropf, including ones for dog owners, cooks and party planners. Several families have moved in, giving children opportunities for live-in playmates.\"This is a rich life,\" Stangeland said. Shes built much of her routine around shared experiences, starting with group breakfast and meditation each morning. And though social activities are always available, its not a setting in which extensive participation is enforced.\"People think you have to be very social (in co-living),\" she said. \"Thats not the case.

To take things further, the style is often set in place on loosely permed hair, to ensure an expertly tousled look.Google searches for these ruffled coiffures are up 100% from 2020, and the term has also seen an 88% increase on Pinterest this year, as more and more teens scour the digital moodboard site to find the picture-perfect wolf cut.On Instagram, hairdressers share studio-lit images of clients sporting more professional versions of the style.

While more cautious -- or affluent -- teenagers will book in at a salon, many are content to use a pair of kitchen scissors or a hand-held razor and brave the cut themselves, while staring into the bathroom mirror.Over on YouTube , teens tip their hair forward to fasten a unicorn-style ponytail at their hairline and gleefully snip away -- and it seems the vast majority are thrilled with the outcome.Most of the 80.7 million TikTok videos attached to the #wolfcut hashtag are success stories, captioned with the zealous stock phrase \"This is your sign to get a wolf cut.\" Part of the styles popularity might be due to the fact that it calls for choppy layers, allowing for many variations and for those with varying degrees of scissor skills to give it a try.Wolf cuts are the latest iteration of a gender-fluid hairstyle. Its predecessor, the mullet, has a history dating back centuries. The Greek poet Homer, writing in \" The Iliad \" in the 8th-century BC, references spearmen with \"forelocks cropped, hair grown long at the backs.\"But the mullet was given an notably androgynous art-rock edge when sported by David Bowie s alter ego Ziggy Stardust in the 1970s.The signature scarlet do was the work of hairdresser Suzi Ronson, who wrote in \"The Moth Presents: All These Wonders\" that Bowie had first seen the spiky hairstyle on a female model and asked if Ronson, who worked at a salon in London at the time, if she could recreate it. \"Thats a little weird -- its a womans hairstyle.\" Ronson wrote. \"And how am I going to actually do it?\"David Bowie performing with guitarist and Suzi Ronsons husband, Mick Ronson at a live recording of The 1980 Floor Show for the NBC Midnight Special TV show, at The Marquee Club in London, 1973.

Early drivers lowered their cars inches from the ground -- often with the help of a few well-placed sandbags -- and cruised them slow through the city streets; they were the opposite of the speedy and popular hot rod.\"I bought my first lowrider in 1958 when I was twelve years old.

And as she continued to photograph, a powerful theme began to emerge from the quietude of her series.\"I began to see that the images featured reverent, natural and introspective women,\" Bedford said. In comparison, \"the entire automotive visual narrative -- not just lowriding -- is male dominated, and women are relegated to sexual accessories.\"\"I began to see that the images featured reverent, natural and introspective women,\" Bedford said.

Back in the day, most people on the Boulevard behind the wheel were men, and the women were sitting next to them. I was different.\"Expressions of identityLowriders may be vehicles, but they are also a creative expression of the owners, becoming objects of identity and history.\"(I had an) interest in how the customization of a car is about having a voice, politically, culturally, creatively,\" Bedford said. \"This specific community has been expressing their identity through this really distinct car culture.\"The lowrider \"Gypsy Rose\" is one of the most famous customized cars in the world, recogniziable for its floral motifs and plush pink interior.

The anticipation of this next stage of humanity left an indelible impression on culture, too.President John F. Kennedys vision of man reaching the moon soon spawned a throng of TV shows and films -- including cartoon sitcom \"The Jetsons\" and the \"Star Trek\" franchise -- all of which looked to cater to Americas newfound interest in space travel.The success of the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 only whetted appetites further. For fashion designers Paco Rabanne, Pierre Cardin and Thierry Mugler, it became the rocket that launched a thousand looks, as they centered whole collections around an intergalactic vision of the future.Whether it was a chain-mail shift dress, a bulbous helmet or a pair of stark white boots, the sartorial legacy of the 60s and 70s was defined by a space-race exuberance. But even decades after we first set foot on the moon, the cosmos has remained a mainstay of inspiration for a variety of fashion houses.Now as a new space race unfolds, this time with a human mission to Mars on the horizon , we take a look back at fashions enduring love affair with outer space, in which art imitates life forms -- whether alien or astronaut -- and celestial bodies alike.Pierre CardinPierre Cardin helped spearhead the space-age aesthetic with an array of ensembles in silver vinyl.

This year, two women doctors, Dr. Sara Saeed Khurram and Dr. Iffat Zafar Aga, have been recognized for their Pakistani telemedicine company Sehat Kahani, which uses an all-female network of doctors. According to the Index Award, the e-clinics provide accessible healthcare and attempt to combat the so-called \"doctor bride\" phenomenon, where many female medical students in the country forgo their careers , under pressure to prioritize motherhood.Long overdue redesignsThis years finalists hope to make seismic changes in the world through a single thoughtfully designed product that, in some cases, update a long-neglected area of medicine. Take the Hegenberger Speculum, for instance, which claims to make it easier for midwives to stitch perineum tears that occur during birth -- something 9 out of 10 women experience, according to the UKs National Health Service (NHS) -- and is made out of silicone instead of metal for more comfort for the patient. The current speculum had not been updated in a century and a half, according to its creator, Malene Hegenberger.\"Its quite a taboo subject,\" Hegenberger told the Danish media outlet Avisen in 2018. \"Women generally dont want to be a bother and theres a lot of other stuff to focus on after childbirth. They put themselves aside and put the child first. I think thats why there hasnt been much done about it.\"This silicone speculum stays expanded while inserted so midwives can use both hands to stitch postpartum tearing, allowing them to perform the proceduce without an assistant and simplifying the process.

Its non-hormonal, made of water and chitosan biopolymers, and works by thickening cervical mucus, preventing sperm from migrating past the vaginal canal.Though Oui has only been tested on animals so far, its creators hope it will provide women with flexible, non-hormonal contraception. Credit: Cirqle BiomedicalOui is meant to be less invasive than implants like Nexplanon and IUDs, which require in-office procedures to insert and remove; provide more flexibility than a daily regimented pill; and cut down on side effects that are common with hormonal birth control, from associations with depression to a higher risk of blood clots and stroke\"The necessity for women who take contraception is to prevent pregnancy, and because this need was the priority and there has been a lack of good alternatives, women (have) had to accept and put up with the side effects,\" said design manager Marie Lyhne in an email interview.Addressing systemic issuesDesigner Antya Waegemann has taken on a deeply complex problem that reaches across healthcare, policing and legal systems in countries around the world including the US: the backlog of hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits -- DNA collection kits which are crucial to identifying and charging sexual assault perpetrators.While sexual assault affects people of all genders, the UN estimates that nearly one in three women over the age of 15 globally have experienced sexual violence, and the statistics for transgender people are even starker at one in two, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC).In the US, the process for testing rape kits is plagued with issues from end to end, from laboratory delays to police destroying them . The problems start right from the beginning, according to Waegemann, who spent a year as a sexual assault advocate at New York Presbyterian Hospital, with confusing package design and collections that can take hours for victims who have just been through a severe trauma.\"It became so clear to me through that process, and also reading the instructions myself, how truly difficult it was to complete this kit,\" she said in a video call.The Margo Kit is a redesigned kit to collect DNA after a sexual assault. Credit: Margo KitThough Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE) are trained to collect the rape kits, there is a national shortage of these types of nurses, and many hospitals will turn away victims if they dont have the staff -- or the kits -- available. According to Waegemann, she rarely saw a SANE professional on staff while volunteering; instead, it was mostly ER doctors and nurses handling the process. They tend to be much less familiar with the kit, Waegemann said, which was first designed in the 1970s and can include up to 16 different envelopes for collecting genital swabs, pubic hair combings and fingernail clippings, among other things.Waegemanns redesigned kit offers color coding and clear instructions for healthcare providers, as well as an app for the victims to follow along with the process and understand each step.The accompanying app helps victims stay informed with a step-by-step explanation. Credit: Margo KitBut Waegemann also wants to make processing and testing the kits easier and faster for police and lab technicians, as well as provide immediate support for victims. Her company, Margo, is working on other products as well that aim to reimagine the system entirely, from how kits are tested and, importantly, tracked, once they leave the hospital, to an app that gives people information on how and where to get tested if theyve been assaulted.\"The designs I have created of course consider the entire system,\" Waegemann said in a follow-up email. \"But they are really about taking an entire process that is designed to exclude victims from taking control and seeking justice, and re-designing the aftermath...\".\"I really believe that a product itself can change a system in a way that sometimes policy cannot,\" she said in the call.On September 30, five winners will be announced from the 46 total finalists. The Index Award lists over €200,000 ($244,000) in prizes for the winners, as well as the potential for the organization to help fund their work moving forward.Top image: A Oui capsule by Cirqle Biomedical", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/index-awards-2021-finalists-womens-health/index.html"}, {"title": "Fashion photographer Kristin-Lee Moolman wants to showcase the real South Africa", "data_published": "2021-05-19T08:17:48Z", "content": "Written by Rebecca Cairns, CNNSouth African photographer Kristin-Lee Moolman has gained international recognition for her powerful portraits against surreal, bleached-out landscapes.In 2020, she won the Rudin Prize for Emerging Photographers, and has worked with big names including Rihanna in a shoot for New York Times Style Magazine, and fashion houses including Dior and Burberry.But her fashion shoots are about more than sleek silhouettes and couture design. Moolman is using her platform to challenge negative media portrayals of South Africa -- and counter the stereotypes perpetuated about her home country.HomecomingMoolman was born into a White Afrikaans family and grew up during the final years of apartheid , a system of legislated racial segregation in South Africa. Apartheid ended in the early 1990s when Nelson Mandela became the countrys first Black president, after fighting against oppression for half a century. The political turmoil in South Africa had a profound effect on Moolman, and her sense of identity.\"I felt so much guilt by association of what my people did to other people,\" she said. \"For a long time, I wanted to get away from being Afrikaans, being White, being South African.\"In 2020, Moolman took part in a virtual photography show, \"28 Hats for Lamu.\" The photos, featuring eccentric headpieces, celebrate the transformative power of creativity. Credit: Courtesy Kristin-Lee MoolmanMoolman began traveling abroad in the mid-2000s, working on commercial fashion shoots and advertising campaigns. \"It was work that emulated what I thought people wanted. There was no soul there,\" she said. \"I reached the conclusion that I couldnt make work that I didnt identify with.\"This wasnt an overnight revelation, she said, but one that took years: a lengthy mental and emotional \"homecoming\" as Moolman changed her perspective on what it meant to be South African.While Moolman describes her lifestyle as \"nomadic\" -- before returning to South Africa for the duration of the pandemic, she was based in Thailand for several months and used to fly frequently around the world for shoots -- she now feels at home in South Africa. The landscapes of her work are free of perspective lines, showing yawning desert dunes and stretches of endless sky, reflecting the small towns she grew up in. \"Everything coalesced when I made this mental and physical move to be at home,\" she said.Moolman shot non-binary DJ and model Caleb Nkosi for arts and culture magazine Document Journal. Credit: Courtesy Kristin-Lee MoolmanCreating a counter-narrativePart of Moolmans struggle with her nationality was a product of what she says was a predominantly negative portrayal of South Africa in the media.The prevalence of stories about poverty, violence, and lack of education in South Africa struck a nerve for Moolman -- while she acknowledges these problems exist, she is frustrated that so much of her countrys \"creativity and joy\" is overlooked.\"Theres this strength of character that people dont show,\" she said, a key part of the counter-narrative her work tries to highlight. Staring directly into the camera, Moolmans diverse subjects are powerful and sculptural against a dreamy, washed-out pastel landscape. This direct gaze helps to neutralize the \"predatory voyeurism\" inherent in photography, she said.This is a still from the shoot for \"Peau de Chagrin/Bleu de Nuit,\" a music video filmed with Belgian-Congolese rapper Baloji. Credit: Courtesy Kristin-Lee MoolmanShowcasing strong womenIn recent years, Moolman says she is focused more on women and showcasing diversity. One of the trigger moments for this focus was Moolmans 2019 shoot with Rihanna, for the superstars Fenty line. \"Rihanna was one of the first ones (shoots) where I realized, you know what? Women are powerful.\"\"I have a tremendous amount of respect for Rihanna, because of her voice in terms of diversity, women, sexuality. I really like her ideology and her view on the world, so to be able to work with her was really cool,\" Moolman said.One of Moolmans latest women-focused projects is \" Banyoloyi A Bosigo \" (\"Ultimate Midnite Angels\").

Moolman, who identifies as queer, is determined to highlight this often-overlooked part of South African identity.The African photographers pushing visual boundariesThe film also marks Moolmans move towards filmmaking, an area that shes been exploring over the last few years. Using film to go deeper into womens stories, Moolman wants to go beyond the movie trope of female characters having to survive trauma such as rape or assault to be considered strong. \"Theres always a condition, a reason they became powerful,\" she said of the cinematic convention. \"Its never shown that theyre powerful to begin with.\"As the medium for her creativity changes, Moolman says honesty is the most important aspect of her work. \"You will never stop evolving, because everything you experience, you assimilate into what you do. So I think my work will continue to change and especially moving into filmmaking more, its just a whole new world of things to explore.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/kristin-lee-moolman-south-africa-photographer-hnk-spc-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire: Enter the mysterious world of Soviet watch collectors", "data_published": "2021-05-11T01:58:14Z", "content": "Brad Lendon , CNN Written byWith pseudonyms like the The Bastard, The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire, theyve banded together deep inside the world of Soviet-era watch collecting.This cabal of watch aficionados spans the globe, albeit in cyberspace, bringing history to the wrists of thousands with timepieces dating back to the days of Stalin.Dashiell Oatman-Stanford calls himself \"a Soviet watch nerd.\" His friends call him The Catalog.His website, Watches of the USSR , reveals why.

He once found a $1,000 Soviet watch for $50. Hes \"the luckiest guy,\" Rosa said.The Broker, meanwhile, can do things that will make your jaw drop. He recalls viewing the third season of the Netflix hit series \"Stranger Things\" and seeing a mission emerge. His 14-year-old son wanted the watch worn by Alexei, the Soviet scientist on the show. Freezing the frame, The Broker determined that it was a Kirovskie model, made by the Soviets First State Watch Factory in the 1950s or 60s.\"I went on a hunt as soon as my son spotted it,\" he said. \"I found it within two weeks for about $36.\"The story illustrates just what make Soviet watch collectors tick. Its a hobby that gives them a relatively cheap way to connect with a bygone world. A working, presentable and likely authentic Soviet-era watch can be easily found on the internet for under $100 and in some cases as low as $40 or $50, Rosa said.And thats what sets Soviet watch collectors apart from your regular horology enthusiasts, said Oatman-Stanford.\"Nobody is buying Russian watches or Soviet watches for the reason that most people buy watches, which is its a fashion piece, a jewelry accessory,\" he said.\"It is purely for the interest and intrigue, exoticism, the military connection.\"Roots in AmericaThe Soviet watch industry traces its roots to what was then Americas industrial heartland.Soviet leader Joseph Stalin wanted to modernize the countrys economy, and precise timing was key to making things runs efficiently.\"To coordinate anything in a modern world you need reliable time pieces, and the Soviets didnt have anything of that sort,\" Oatman-Stanford said.Lacking the domestic manufacturing capacity, the Soviet leadership looked overseas and found help in Canton, Ohio.The equipment and know-how for Moscows First State Watch Factory was imported from Dueber-Hampden Watch Co., a Canton company that went bankrupt in the late 1920s, according to the citys local newspaper, the Canton Repository . A 2016 report in the paper said that a company representing the Soviet Unions trade interests in the United States \"bought bankrupt Dueber-Hampdens watchmaking machines for $325,000, loaded it onto train cars and shipped it off to Russia.\"The Dueber-Hampden Watch Works in Canton, Ohio. The USSR went on to buy equipment from the factory and ship it to Moscow. Credit: AlamyBecause the Soviets were short on skilled labor, they brought in American workers too, paying them handsomely for their efforts with an average yearly salary the equivalent of $70,000 in todays currency -- plus free housing and travel expenses. One worker bragged that he was being paid \"more than ... Stalin, earned at the time,\" the Repository reported.With the equipment to kick-start their watch industry, the Soviets also brought in technology from places like France and Switzerland to improve their watchmaking. Victory over Nazi Germany in World War II also gave the Soviet watch industry a boost, said Rosa.The Soviets copied some of the best timepieces worn by German soldiers, he added. \"Those happen to be the most expensive of the Russian watches -- the ones that are exactly copied from the German military,\" Rosa said.Using all those resources, more factories were established around the country, and they turned out hundreds of millions of watches before the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991.A tank on your wristRosa said the watches became a symbol of Soviet resilience and pride in a country that had rallied to defeat Nazi Germany and become a world superpower.One of the most famous Soviet watch brands -- Pobeda -- is the Russian word for \"victory.\" The name was ordered directly by the Kremlin after World War II, according to the website of its manufacturer, Raketa. The watches \"symbolize the willpower and heroism of the Russian people,\" the website says.\"Theres a sense of grit with their watches,\" Rosa said, describing them as \"robust.\"\"You feel like youre putting a tank on your wrist,\" he said, admitting that the military connection is what first appealed to him. But theres room in Soviet watch collecting for those who arent military enthusiasts.CS Lee, aka The Vampire, said the military models dont do much for him. He loves designs based on polar expeditions or space flight. These are the pride of his collection of 500-plus Soviet-era watches.A Komandirskie -- or \"Commanders\" -- watch by Vostok, which supplied the Soviet ministry. Credit: AlamyOatman-Stanford, meanwhile, is partial to the dress styles, with \"simple and clean\" designs.\"I find Soviet designs tasteful and interesting, the Cyrillic writing exotic and alluring, the history endlessly fascinating, the prices affordable and the number of variations mind-boggling,\" he said on this website.Like Rosa, Oatman-Stanford is struck by the reliability of Soviet timepieces.\"The Soviets built their watches so smartly and so well,\" he said. And they standardized components, making repairs and service easy.\"If a part from one fails, you can go to almost any other watch from this factory and this era and swap it over.\"The rise of the FrankensWhile that interchangeability was a convenience in the Soviet era, it can be a headache for modern collectors.When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it left an economy in disarray. Citizens looked for ways to get money, and their millions of watches offered an opportunity. Lee said that Soviet watch factories turned out 30 million to 50 million watches a year, and that a Polish contact told him of Russians selling timepieces by weight for as little as $5 a kilogram (2.2 pounds).Some salvagers dug through piles of watches looking for gold to melt down and sell. Others mined them for parts and assembled them into new watches, which collectors call \"Frankens\" -- a reference to Frankenstein.In Russia, Oatman-Stanford said, they have another term. \"The translation for this is cutlet, like ground beef,\" he said, \"a kind of mishmash of parts that theyve smushed together to form a patty.\"A worker at the Second Moscow Clock factory assembles a watch. Credit: AlamyTo novice and experienced collectors alike, the Frankens can be hard to spot. Bureau members look for clues, like the words on the dial, the shape of the crown and machining marks on the inner workings. But they point out that theres really no single authority to determine where these watches came from -- themselves included.While Frankens may not epitomize the Soviet era, they can be just as much fun for the not-so-serious enthusiast, the collectors say, while still giving a sense of the Cold War.\"It seems fashionable now to look toward what is nostalgic, and I think a lot of people are interested in these cool, unique pieces from history,\" Oatman-Stanford said.And even if an acquisition turns out to be a fake, Lee said, the price -- likely below $100 -- is worth the experience.You can never have enough friendsFor English speakers, Frankens and authentic originals can be quickly found on websites such as eBay and Etsy. Some of the dozens of brands to look for include the aforementioned Pobeda and Raketa, as well as Komandirskie, Sekonda, Slava, Strela and Vostok.To improve your chances of getting a fair price for an authentic timepiece -- and one that will actually show up in the mail -- the Bureau of Russian Watch Intelligence advises paying careful attention to the reviews. Most of the Bureau got their starts shopping online, though once they got serious, they found better, cheaper sources.Lee said he has contacts in places like Spain, Italy, Russia and Romania who will search flea markets for him, looking for specific watches he wants to add to his collection.A 1980 Soviet poster depicts a worker in hardhat with his wristwatch projecting the image of a factory. Credit: Ruben Suryaninov/Digital Soviet Art/Getty Images\"You can never have enough friends,\" he said.Meanwhile, Oatman-Stanford, who can repair and refurbish his own watches, said he has established a network of middlemen who buy him cheap watches on the Russian and Ukraine domestic markets.\"I send them money and then they send me in bulk -- 20, 50, a hundred at a time,\" he said. He can then sort the wheat from the chaff himself.When Rosa wants something, hell often consult a mysterious figure known as The Oracle, a Ukrainian who only communicates by email.\"The Oracle never talks to anyone in person,\" Rosa said, but \"he knows it all ... Theres no fooling this guy.\"Pulling the triggerAfter exploring the world of Soviet watches, I needed one of my own. I scoured the web for hours searching for an authentic model.With some advice from Oatman-Stanford, I pulled the trigger on a Vostok Amphibian, which collectors affectionately call \"Scuba Dude\" for the diver on the dial. The package arrived from Russia complete with Cyrillic stamps and an illegible handwritten return address.A Vostok Amphibian, known as \"Scuba Dude.\" Credit: John Mees/CNNExamining it via video chat, Rosa said my Scuba Dude ticked all the boxes, including the \"Made in CCCP\" on the dial -- proof that, as advertised, it was manufactured in the 1980s, before the CCCP (the Russian abbreviation for the USSR) collapsed.Purchase a few more of these and I could become a card-carrying member of the Bureau of Russian Watch Intelligence, Rosa suggested.The Journalist isnt taken yet.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/soviet-russian-watches-collectors-intl-hnk-dst/index.html"}, {"title": "Even before Covid struck, Modi's $1.8B architectural revamp divided opinions", "data_published": "2021-05-09T00:03:20Z", "content": "Many Indians are horrified that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is rebuilding the capitals historic center in a pandemic. But debate among politicians, architects and heritage experts runs deeper still.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis overhaul of New Delhis historic center was always going to be controversial -- even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck.Since it was announced in September 2019, the $1.8 billion Central Vista Redevelopment Project has been branded unduly expensive, environmentally irresponsible and a threat to cultural heritage. And with Modis elaborate new private residence -- which comprises 10 buildings across 15 acres (6 hectares) of land -- among dozens of planned new government structures, many critics have dismissed the scheme as an architectural vanity project that serves Indias populist leader, not its people.This outrage has been brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus crisis. Amid a devastating second wave that has pushed the countrys hospitals to breaking point, opposition MP Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter last week to compare the cost of the project to the amount needed to vaccinate 450 million Indians or purchase 10 million oxygen cylinders. \"But (Modis) ego is bigger than peoples lives,\" he concluded.A man walks past the construction site for part of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project. Credit: Manish Rajput/SOPA Images/Sipa USAIndignation has only grown in recent days, after it emerged that construction at the site has been deemed an \"essential service\" -- meaning work continues, even as building projects elsewhere are at a standstill. This urgency is widely thought to reflect a race to complete the new triangular parliament -- the projects centerpiece -- before the end of 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence.Indeed, for nationalists, the buildings symbolism lies not only in its design, which alludes to the importance of triangles in the sacred geometries of several religions, but in Indias ability to complete large-scale infrastructure projects quickly and on schedule.But while the speed, cost and timing of the development have attracted ire, the underlying question of whether New Delhis aging government district needs revamping exposes deeper divides.“ Theres really been no opportunity for comments, criticism, suggestions, ideas. Theres a vibrant architectural community and very few of them feel like theyve been given a fair hearing. ” Shashi Tharoor, MP and writerIndian MP and writer Shashi Tharoor, a fierce critic of Modis, has long rallied against the project. Since the earliest days of the pandemic he has called for the government to redirect funds earmarked for the development to help fight Covid-19.\"Why now, at such colossal expense and at a time when the country and economy are reeling from the effects of the lockdown?\" he told CNN in a phone interview earlier this year.Yet even this most vocal of critics accepted that modernizing Indias parliament and Central Visa -- a 3-kilometer (1.8-mile) stretch of New Delhis central boulevard, Rajpath -- could, in theory, have its merits.\"From a purely utilitarian point of view, many would agree there is a need for some significant changes,\" Tharoor said. \"One is that the parliament building would have needed an extensive renovation to be fit for purpose, and clearly the government concluded that they couldnt do that, and that they needed to build a new one.\"The project will see an overhaul of buildings and public space along New Delhis central boulevard, Rajpath. Credit: HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd\"And as for the Central Vista, a number of the 1950s and 60s buildings, some of which Ive had the dubious pleasure of working in ... there really is an architectural case for getting rid of them and replacing them.\"My concern here is the utter lack of consultation before such a momentous decision was taken,\" he said, adding: \"Theres really been no opportunity for comments, criticism, suggestions, ideas. Theres a vibrant architectural community and very few of them feel like theyve been given a fair hearing.\"Fit for purpose?When work began on the original Central Vista plan in the early 20th century, English architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker envisaged a long ceremonial boulevard akin to the Champs Elysees in Paris or the Capitol Complex in Washington D.C.It came to be known as Kingsway, and the grand buildings running along its edges were designed to serve a colonial government, not an Indian one.When the country gained independence from Britain in 1947, India sought to reappropriate the district for its own burgeoning democracy. A statue of King George VI, the then-reigning British king and last emperor of India, was torn down, but the colonial structures were largely retained and repurposed. The circular council house became Indias parliament, the opulent Viceroys House was transformed into a presidential residence and Kingsway was given a new name: Rajpath.Known as Viceroy House by the British, Rashtrapati Bhavan now serves as the presidential residence. Credit: ShutterstockIn the decades that followed, development in the area accelerated to accommodate the growing administration. Police barracks were erected, car parking was introduced, and new ministry buildings spilled out either side of the central boulevard.According to the architect behind the new redevelopment, Bimal Patel, this \"haphazard\" sprawl has corrupted Lutyens and Bakers original urban plan and left the area unfit for a modern government. Designs by Patels firm, HCP, were chosen from six proposals in a competition to reimagine the area and modernize the facilities.\"You have old stables and barracks that have been converted into offices -- theyre completely dysfunctional. Its like an old slum -- its like a little village in there,\" said Patel in a video interview, referring to some of the buildings flanking Rajpath.His firms sweeping vision for the 86-acre (35-hectare) site includes new chambers for MPs, a conference center and landscaped public gardens. The countrys National Archives will be refurbished, while the North and South Blocks of the Secretariat Building, which currently house Indias cabinet, will be turned into museums.“ We need to improve the technology, we need space for dining, we need to create toilets, we need to create storage space, and office and administration space -- its very clear that it cant be done in the space available. ” Bimal Patel, architectWith the creation of new office space, ministries currently scattered around New Delhi will all be relocated to the site. Patel argues this will make the Central Vista a \"synergistic location\" that will improve the efficiency and productivity of Indias government.The symbolic heart of the project is the countrys new parliament. HCPs triangular design sits directly next to its predecessor, which is also being turned into a museum. Inside, two horseshoe-shaped chambers will house the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha -- the parliaments upper and lower houses respectively -- while a light-filled Constitution Hall features an adjoining gallery displaying Indias written constitution.MPs will be seated in twos rather than crammed onto long benches, and the new, larger parliament features touch screens for each member.For Patel, this modernization is a matter of necessity. While the current parliament has been updated over the decades, with new floors added, the old building is now simply too small, he argued.A digital impression of the new Lok Sabha, the Indian parliaments lower chamber. Credit: HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd\"Its crowded and theres no more possibility for expansion at a time when we need to increase the number of seats,\" Patel said, alluding to a planned increase in the number of Indian MPs to reflect the countrys growing population.\"We need to improve the technology, we need space for dining, we need to create toilets, we need to create storage space, and office and administration space -- its very clear that it cant be done in the space available, so weve created a new facility next door.\"Ongoing concernsOn Wednesday, two Indian citizens lodged a case with the Delhi High Court to try to halt work at the Central Vista, arguing construction could aid the spread of Covid-19. The petitioners then took the matter to the Supreme Court, after city authorities had \"failed to appreciate the gravity\" of the situation.This is not the first attempt to formally oppose the revamp. In April last year, eight months before Modi laid the parliaments foundation stone in a high-profile photo-op, a petition was filed to the Supreme Court opposing plans on legal and environmental grounds. The next month, a group of 60 former civil servants wrote a scathing open letter to Modi describing the project as a \"thoughtless and irresponsible act\" that was motivated by \"a superstitious belief that the present Parliament building is unlucky.\"The wide-ranging letter went on to discuss the \"severe environmental damage\" the redevelopment will cause to \"the lungs of the city.\" The plans are \"shrouded in secrecy,\" it read, and \"not substantiated by any public consultation or expert review.\"A copy of Indias constitution will be on display in the new parliament building. Credit: HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt LtdThe group also highlighted the architectural value of buildings earmarked for demolition, saying that the scheme would \"irrevocably\" destroy the areas cultural heritage.Historian Swapna Liddle, who has written various books on New Delhis history, echoed some of their concerns. She highlighted the risks of turning symbolic political buildings -- like the North and South Blocks --- into museums.\"When you say North Block you dont just mean a building, you mean a particular institution,\" Liddle said over the phone. \"The fact that buildings are associated with history, with traditions and with institutions is very important.\"Parliament House is the place where constitutional debate (has taken place), so you should think very long and hard before separating the building from the tradition.\"The North Block of the Secretariat Building will be turned into a museum. Credit: ShutterstockIn a polarized political landscape, its perhaps little surprise that a project of this magnitude has invited criticism from many quarters.

The easing of state censorship heralded a new era of free expression. It also meant that G-funk, boom bap and gangster rap soon arrived on the airwaves -- including the track that made a lasting impression on the then-teenage Munkherdene: Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggs \"187 On an Undercover Cop.\"\"I realized I could put my poems on a beat like them, and I started writing rap music,\" he recalled in a video interview from his studio in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolias capital.Growing up in one of Ulaanbaatars impoverished ger districts, Munkherdene could empathize with the kind of urban hardship chronicled in the music he idolized. Comprised largely of semi-permanent tents (or gers, the Mongolian word for yurts), these sprawling outer-city settlements have tripled in size since 1990, as a traditionally nomadic population is lured to the capital.Most of the districts low-income households rely on wood-burning stoves -- or until a ban in 2019 , coal-burning ones -- sending pollution across the skies of a city where winter temperatures regularly fall below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. As a child, Munkherdene would walk several kilometers a day to fetch water.1 / 10 Rapper Big Gee riding a Bactrian camel in Mongolias capital.

The start of my rap career was very hard,\" he said. \"We didnt have a way to make good money, to make high-quality audio and video, or to work with big companies. Television and radio stations blocked our music and videos. They thought hip-hop was a bad thing.\"Now, more than two decades later, the 37-year-old, known professionally as Big Gee, is one of the countrys best-known MCs. A regular fixture on Mongolian television, and even the star of a KFC ad , he is the heavily tattooed, sports car-driving epitome of the rags-to-riches hip-hop tale.But he and Mongolias rap community are little-known outside the landlocked country. This is, in part, what prompted British photographer and director Alex de Mora to capture some of the scenes colorful characters in \"Straight Outta Ulaanbaatar,\" a documentary and book that profile a selection of the citys crews and artists, as well B-boys, a record store owner and a tattooist.\"When most people think about Mongolia, they think about big open expanses, and maybe theyve heard of a two-humped camel or have seen people riding around on horses ... but theyve never thought about contemporary culture in an urban environment,\" De Mora said on a video call from London. \"Thats what I wanted to show -- that across the world there are different things going on where cultures are crossing over.\"Mongolian rapper Maberrant, pictured by photographer Alex de Mora in the passenger seat of a car.

He often eschews the cliched tropes of hip-hop photography, an approach maintained during his self-funded trip to Mongolia. While some of the portraits show local rappers flaunting their jewelry or posing in -- or on top of -- their cars, many are warmer and more playful than the genre usually dictates.\"I try and avoid the obvious bravado-type portraits,\" he said. \"Its quite funny when you get your camera out and a guy starts posing, which is good to have some of. But with this project I wanted to find more intimate and personal moments.\"Big Gee, whose image features on the cover of De Moras book, also serves as the documentarys central figure and narrator. The issues he addresses tell a wider story about the challenges of life in Ulaanbaatar.\"In Mongolia we have lots of problems -- social issues, unemployment, alcoholism corruption and many more,\" Munkherdene told CNN, adding: \"The government isnt taking care of the Mongolian people, theyre just taking care of themselves .\"One of Ulaanbaatars sprawling ger districts. Credit: Alex de MoraThe rapper is known for speaking out about corruption and abuses of power. But if these themes are common to hip-hop around the world, then many of the other topics he raps about are specific to his homeland: struggles in the ger district and the pride of his Mongolian ancestry (Munkherdene has the word \"Mongol\" tattooed in traditional script beneath his left eye). He has also used his lyrics to rally against Chinese-operated mines for their alleged mistreatment of local workers -- controversially so, due to his use of a derogatory racial slur (his manager told CNN that the rapper had not used the word in reference to Chinese people, though the music video in question has nonetheless been deleted from YouTube).And, like many Mongolian folk songs, theres another important theme woven through his music: nature.\"Ive done some songs about protecting nature, (and I have one called) Leave My Country to Us. Whats the real richness? Money? Gold? In my opinion, its not money not gold, not bling-bling things, not big chains or big cars. Real richness is human beings and pure nature.\"Portrait of a cityFittingly, nature is also a central character in De Moras photos. Mountains, sand dunes and -- on unpolluted days -- rich blue skies are never far away in Ulaanbaatar. One shot sees Big Gee holding an eagle and sitting proudly on the back of a Bactrian camel; others replace the urban backdrops typical of hip-hop photography with the vast, empty landscapes found at the citys outskirts.\"They call (Mongolia) the Land of the Blue Sky for very good reason,\" De Mora said. \"Its something that makes the photographs themselves very vivid. Ive never seen so much sun and blue sky in my life.\"Though De Moras project assumes the perspective of a particular subculture, it is, in truth, a broad portrait of the Mongolian capital. His photos paint a wider picture of the citys diverse residents, complete with kids playing in the streets and an elderly accordion player.Big Gee poses in front of a Genghis Khan statue in Ulaanbaatar.

The combination of English graffiti and Cyrillic signs hint at the varying cultural forces at work in the city.Aside from a song by the young Mongolian rapper Maberrant, played during the closing credits, the soundtrack looks to folk instruments, wind chimes and eerie natural sounds rather than hip-hop.\"I didnt want people to watch the film and judge the people by the music,\" said De Mora. \"I wanted them to watch the film and understand the city and the personality of the people and the place ... It was always a portrait of a city, and a culture within a city. It was never going to be a critique or a review of the music.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/straight-outta-ulaanbaatar-mongolia-hip-hop/index.html"}, {"title": "Why some Asian Americans are embracing their heritage by dropping their anglicized names", "data_published": "2021-04-07T08:47:09Z", "content": "Jessie Yeung , CNN Written byThis feature is part of CNN Styles new series Hyphenated , which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.Tshab Her grew up feeling like she lived a double life.Like many Asian Americans, the 29-year-old Hmong American artist was always switching between two names: an Asian name and her \"American\" name.Jennifer, her legal first name, was what teachers and employers called her, and what she used in \"White spaces,\" she said. But her middle name Tshab, which means \"new\" in the Hmong language, was what her family and close friends called her within their small community in Aurora, Illinois.The Hmong ethnic group is spread across China and Southeast Asia, but most Hmong Americans -- like Hers parents -- are refugees from Laos who fled during the Vietnam War.\"When I went as Jennifer, I felt like I was playing a role -- this White-assimilated, American Dream type,\" said Her, now based in Chicago. \"Tshab and Jennifer were always at tension with each other ... I felt like I was always living a different life as Jennifer, than who I wanted to be as Tshab.\"Theres a long history of Asian Americans using Anglo or anglicized names -- whether they adopted new White-sounding names like John or Jennifer, or changed the pronunciation or spelling of their original name to better suit English speakers. The practice was popularized in the 19th century due, in part, to fear in the face of intense racism and xenophobia.Tshab Her, a Hmong American artist whose work pays homage to her heritage and family. Credit: Tshab HerAmerica has since undergone a cultural sea change. The past decade alone has seen surging demand for greater diversity, inclusion and representation. And as the national conversation shifts, many Asian Americans, including high-profile creatives and celebrities, are facing similar personal reckonings with their names.The list includes comedian and producer Hasan Minhaj, whose interview on the Ellen DeGeneres went viral when he corrected her on the pronunciation of his name; Marvel actress Chloe Bennet, who said she changed her surname from Wang because \"Hollywood is racist\" ; and \"Star Wars\" actress Kelly Marie Tran, who called her familys decision to adopt anglicized names \"a literal erasure of culture.\"After reflecting on her identity and how she presented herself, Her decided to drop Jennifer and go by Tshab when she started college. It felt empowering, she said -- an affirmation of heritage, the Hmong language, and her parents journey to the United States in the 70s and 80s.Unbeknown to many Americans, Hmong soldiers were recruited by the CIA during the Vietnam War. They died by the thousands and were forced to flee when the US withdrew from Vietnam, essentially abandoning the ethnic group. To this day, the Hmong community is among the most marginalized Asian American groups.For Her, just existing under her Hmong name \"creates space in itself\" and pays tribute to her roots, she said.An artist, she also incorporates the journey from one name to another in her work, which celebrates Hmong history and iconography. One embroidery piece reads \"Its pronounced Cha,\" while another reads \"My name is Tshab, but the check is payable to Jennifer Her.\"A history of violence and assimilationAsian Americans have been Anglicizing their names since the first major wave of immigrants in the late 1800s and into the 20th century -- a practice also common among Jewish and European immigrants, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).There are a number of reasons why, with the most basic being convenience. English speakers often had trouble pronouncing or spelling non-English names, and for many immigrants it was just easier to choose a new \"American\" name. There were financial motivations, too -- immigrant business owners may have felt that an anglicized name would better appeal to customers.Over the years, USCIS archives have recorded countless such name changes from a Russian immigrant named Simhe Kohnovalsky who asked to become Sam Cohn in 1917, to a wartime refugee named Sokly Ny, who fled Cambodia in 1979 during the Khmer Rouge regime and renamed himself Don Bonus in California, inspired by a \"bonus pack\" of gum.Chinese immigrants play cards while waiting in the immigration offices at Ellis Island, US, around 1940-1950. Credit: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesAny change that might smooth their way to the American Dream was seen (by many immigrants) as a step in the right direction,\" wrote Marian Smith, a former USCIS historian, in a 2005 essay , adding: \"There were all kinds of reasons, political and practical, to take a new name.\"But this seemingly eager pursuit of the American Dream doesnt fully capture the dark realities immigrants faced. Asians in the US were often demonized, exploited and discriminated against from the moment they arrived. Assimilation -- including the adoption of a new name -- was seen a survival tactic.Japanese Americans -- the majority of whom were US citizens -- were forced into concentration camps during World War II. Early Chinese immigrants were lynched by mobs, and anti-Chinese sentiment was so strong that the US banned all immigration from China between 1882 and 1943. The fearmongering \"Yellow Peril\" ideology meanwhile depicted East Asians as dangerous invaders. An estimated 120,000 Japanese Americans -- the majority of whom were US citizens -- were forced into concentration camps during World War II.Asian men being interrogated by an immigration officer on February 2, 1951 in Brooklyn, New York. Credit: AFP/Getty ImagesAn increasing number of Japanese Americans changed their personal names during wartime in order to \"prove their patriotism and to reaffirm their American identities,\" according to a 1999 paper in Names, a journal dedicated to onomastics (the study of names). \"Makoto became Mac, and Isamu shrank to Sam.\"Asians in the 19th and early 20th century were largely portrayed as \"strange, but also inferior, dirty, uncivilized,\" said Catherine Ceniza Choy, a professor of Asian American and Asian diaspora studies at the University of California, Berkeley. \"(Back then) the desire to fit in is also about surviving an overtly racist, hostile society\" that targeted \"Asian difference.\"In the period 1900 to 1930, about 86% of boys and 93% of girls born to immigrants (of all origins, not just of Asian heritage) had an \"American name,\" according to US census data analyzed in the journal Labour Economics.Now, a century later, its common for members of the third or fourth generation not to have an Asian name at all.The cost of sacrificing a nameThe nation and its racial tensions have evolved since then -- but Asian and non-English names continue to be othered, treated as strange or used as cheap punchlines.In 2013, for instance, a TV station reporting on a deadly Asiana Airlines plane crash fell for a prank, and announced that the pilots included \"Captain Sum Ting Wong\" and \"Ho Lee Fuk.\" In 2016, the governor of Maine joked about a Chinese man named Chiu, pronouncing it with a fake sneeze. In 2020, a professor at Laney College asked a student, Phuc Bui Diem Nguyen, to Anglicize her Vietnamese name \"to avoid embarrassment\" because Phuc Bui \"sounds like an insult in English.\" The list goes on.Asian Americans have continued to proactively adapt their names, many citing ongoing forms of discrimination. Bennet, who started her acting career as Chloe Wang, spoke out about changing her surname on social media after being questioned about it in 2017.\"Changing my last name doesnt change the fact that my BLOOD is half Chinese, that I lived in China, speak Mandarin or that I was culturally raised both American and Chinese,\" she wrote. \"It means I had to pay my rent, and Hollywood is racist and wouldnt cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable.\"Kelly Marie Tran poses with Star Wars stormtroopers on the red carpet in London on December 18, 2019. Credit: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty ImagesTran, the \"Star Wars\" actress, has also spoken publicly about the pain of assimilating. Growing up, she internalized racist narratives \"that made my parents deem it necessary to abandon their real names and adopt American ones -- Tony and Kay -- so it was easier for others to pronounce, a literal erasure of culture that still has me aching to the core,\" she wrote in the New York Times , before declaring, \"You might know me as Kelly ... My real name is Loan.\"Their public testimonies are part of a growing conversation about the potential psychological toll of adapting or compromising your birth name. Names arent just an arbitrary collection of letters and sounds; for Asian Americans, who often juggle multiple languages, cultures and socioethnic circles, a name can encompass various elements of identity.Tanaïs, a Bengali-American novelist and owner of a beauty and fragrance brand. Credit: Max CohenFor instance, Tanaïs, a Bengali American novelist and owner of a beauty and fragrance brand, was born with the name Tanwi Nandini Islam. Tanaïs, 38, uses they and them pronouns.Their parents, who had immigrated to the US from Bangladesh, chose their birth name carefully; \"Tanwi\" has various meanings in Sanskrit, including a blade of grass. \"Nandini\" means daughter, and is another name for the goddess Durga. And \"Islam,\" which also reflects their familys Muslim background, means peace. Tanaïs, the name they go by today, is the combination of the first two letters of the three names.\"To have a name that holds all these cultural meanings, is very powerful,\" they said. \"I am all of those things, from my ancestors to where I am now.\"But during childhood, nobody knew how to say \"Tanwi,\" or put any real effort into learning, they said. Tanaïs does not even remember teachers saying their name out loud, with a first grade teacher declaring that \"Tanwi\" was too hard to pronounce and using Tony instead.\"I was Tony for the whole year. I hated it, it wasnt my name,\" said Tanaïs. \"I remember being very unhappy -- I felt misunderstood. I felt misgendered because it sounded like a boys name to me.\"To accidentally bungle someones name upon introduction can be an innocent mistake. But to deliberately dismiss their name as too strange or complicated to attempt, like Tanaïs teacher did, sends the message that \"you dont matter, you dont belong,\" said Choy, the UC Berkeley professor.\"The consistent mispronunciation or misspelling of ones Asian name -- questions and requests for you to simplify or change your name -- do take a toll on ones individual psyche,\" she said. \"Names reflect your presence, your being, your history. When people constantly do that, theyre not acknowledging you -- as a person, as a human being.\"Research has reinforced just how pervasive this problem is. A 2018 survey of Chinese students in the US found that the \"adoption of an Anglo name was associated with lower levels of self-esteem, which further predicted lower levels of health and well-being.\"However, the study cautioned that it could be a case of correlation, not causation -- for instance, people who already have higher self-esteem could be more reluctant to change their names, and less influenced by stigma.Another survey of ethnic minority students, conducted by California researchers in 2012, concluded that \"many students of color have encountered cultural disrespect within their K-12 education in regards to their names ... When a child goes to school and their name is mispronounced or changed, it can negate the thought, care and significance of the name, and thus the identity of the child.\"Minhaj, the comedian and producer, called out Anglo-centric hypocrisy surrounding names during a segment on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" where he corrected the host on the pronunciation of his name.\"When I first started doing comedy, people were like, You should change your name,\" he went on to explain. \"And Im like, Im not going to change my name. If you can pronounce Ansel Elgort, you can pronounce Hasan Minhaj.\"A reclamation of heritageThere are, however, signs of gradual change.The number of people adopting new names fell in the late 20th century, said Smith, the former USCIS historian. This was partly due to the emergence of automated systems, like those used to register drivers licenses, that are designed for just one legal name. But social change was likely a bigger factor, she said.\"While the economic, legal, systemic pressure to maintain one name grew, social pressure to Americanize names also lessened as more Americans embraced cultural pluralism or multiculturalist views,\" Smith said in an email.We see this cultural shift in how people respond to instances of discrimination or xenophobia. Things that previously may have flown under the radar are now being called out, loudly and publicly.For instance, the writer Jeanne Phillips sparked intense outrage in 2018 when she encouraged parents not to give their children \"foreign names\" on her syndicated column Dear Abby, adding that they can sound \"grating in English.\" Furious parents and minority commentators argued she was perpetuating racist and assimilationist narratives, in a controversy that made national headlines.The Laney College professor who asked a Vietnamese student to Anglicize her name also faced widespread backlash and was placed on administrative leave.Demonstrators gather for a rally against anti-Asian racism and violence on March 13, 2021 in Seattle, Washington.

After several news outlets released In March,the Atlanta spa shootings thatkilled eight people -- six of whom were Asian women -- reignited similar conversations. After several news outlets released abridged or inaccurate versions of the victims names, furious and grieving Asian Americans spoke out online about the racist treatment of their names amid a wave of anti-Asian violence and hate crimes.\"PLEASE STOP BUTCHERING THE VICTIMS NAMES,\" tweeted Michelle Kim , co-founder of Awaken, an organization that runs diversity and inclusion workshops. \"These might be small inconveniences to people. But our names are our IDENTITY. Its our HERITAGE. Its what we have left that remind us WHO WE ARE. WHERE WE COME FROM.\"These recent controversies are a reminder of how much work is left to be done -- but also show that minority groups, and wider society, are redefining the norms of what is acceptable and what needs to be held accountable. It reflects an increasingly multicultural context -- a shift that has resulted from broader changes around the world like globalization and a reshuffling of power.\"Going as Tshab was an act of resistance... That was the start of me resisting this Whiteness of American culture that was forced on me.\" Tshab HerSome Asian countries have become major political and economic players in recent decades, and have also wielded influence in the form of soft power. Bollywood, K-pop, anime and other aspects of Asian pop culture, for example, have gained legions of fans worldwide. And in the US, immigration policies in the late 20th century have allowed the Asian American population to increase exponentially, said Choy.\"Thats just such a different social context to be in, compared to the way it was in the 50s, 60s, 70s,\" she said, adding that technological advances and globalization mean the \"dominance of Anglo-American culture\" is now \"lessened.\"This new chapter is reflected in the growing demand for greater diversity across nearly every sector: entertainment, politics, food, education and more. And among young Asian Americans, there is also an increasing awareness of what their immigrant parents or grandparents had to give up to survive -- a \"realization that there is a loss of heritage and culture from the Asian home country,\" said Choy.For some, this realization can spark a desire to get back what was lost. By studying their parents or grandparents first language, for instance. Others might visit their ancestral homes to reconnect with their culture.Tshab Hers work \"Returning,\" is inspired by the first time her parents traveled back to Laos since they immigrated to the United States as refugees.

He has Andrew Thomas Huang is used to creatingimpossible worlds. He has summoned volcanoes and pulled cities from roiling landscapes. He has choreographed dances for fairies . He has shrunk the moon into a ball small enough to hold in your hand.The 36-year-old filmmaker and artist made a name for himself directing music videos for the likes of FKA Twigs, Perfume Genius and Björk, using puppetry and digital effects to build alternate universes. Whether making these high-profile videos or his own independent short films, Huangs trademark has always been technical wizardry. \"I get excited when I see something and I cant see the seams,\" he said over a video call from his home in Los Angeles.Now Huang is entering new territory -- and with new priorities. His latest project, a feature-length coming-of-age fantasy movie called \"Tiger Girl,\" has a story that pulls just as much weight as the visuals.Huang on set filming the proof-of-concept trailer for his upcoming film \"Tiger Girl.\" Credit: Courtesy Matea Friend\"I do feel like theres often a weird division,\" said Huang. \"There are those (filmmakers) who are really great at writing spoken words -- acting, story, performance. Theres a sphere of craft there. But then theres also a sphere of people who really get off on just visuals and design. Ive noticed that theres this bridge between the two thats very difficult to cross.\"\"Tiger Girl\" is more personal than much of Huangs previous work, drawing inspiration from his own Chinese American family. It follows a teenage girl who is -- like Huangs mother -- growing up in 1960s LA while struggling to reconcile her own identity with family expectations. Then she finds a tiger living in their attic.While the \"Tiger Girl\" script is still in late development, Huang released a pastel-hued short film, \"Lily Chan and The Doom Girls\" last year, that hints at the movies eventual look and feel. It features a shy protagonist who whiles away an afternoon with a group of bad girls sporting cat-eye eyeliner and teased hair. They chug beers in a parking lot and run around an empty swimming pool, bathed in milky California light. The fact that all the girls are Asian American makes this teenage dream feel quietly subversive; mainstream narratives about 60s youth culture have long excluded teenagers who look like them.Although Huang had been thinking about \"Tiger Girl\" for a decade, he said Donald Trumps presidential inauguration in 2017 drove him to finally pursue the project.\"I just felt, at that political moment, like, Why am I making work for this privileged, small audience?\" he said. \"I was doing this kind of digital art exhibition (at the time), and I still value that work. But I felt like, if this work doesnt make people laugh or cry, and its so expensive to make, then why am I making it?\"By that point, Huang had made countless music videos and shorts -- all visually dazzling, but with less emphasis on dialogue and story. He started to think that storytelling could help him to connect with viewers on a deeper level. Maybe, instead of making imaginary worlds, he could use his own as a starting point.Magic accepted as factHuang first discovered the fantasy genre in elementary school. Growing up in a suburb of LA, he fell in love with Jim Henson films like \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal,\" becoming obsessed with the art of puppetry. He longed to shape the foam, cut the patterns and work the armatures.Later, he started working with digital animation tools, which he describes as being \"a little bit more efficient.\" Still, he has never abandoned hands-on craft. Even with digital assistance, puppets and practical effects form the core of his aesthetic.More recently, Huang has found inspiration in artists like Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, whose work he said, incorporates elements that \"speak truth to a spiritual realism or dream logic.\" This approach stands in stark contrast to what Huang sees as Western narratives obsession with rules, even in sci-fi and fantasy. Huang is hungry for stories that arent so \"rationally tidy.\"\"I even think the word supernatural kind of kills the magic,\" he said. \"I like when magic is just accepted as fact.\"Telling personal stories has always felt more fraught for Huang than fantasy. He identifies as queer and grew up in an intensely Christian household where the church had instilled an intensely \"prudish\" attitude toward sex. While hes no longer Christian, the filmmaker said religion has had a long-lasting influence -- pushing him to ask big questions about morality, sacrifice and existence: \"It continues to be a huge reason why I am interested in finding alternative languages for speaking about personal, spiritual, emotional and sexual experiences.\"Two years ago, online video platform Nowness asked Huang to contribute to a series of films about sex. Specifically, he was asked to make work about queer Asian sexuality. He balked at first.\"I was terrified of the idea of making a work that was so vulnerable,\" he said. \"And for a moment, I was like, Why am I burdened with the task of tokenizing, and having to make a piece about me and my intersection? But then another part of me was like, Well, you havent done it yet.\"The resulting short film, \"Kiss of the Rabbit God,\" follows a young worker at a Cantonese restaurant who meets -- and is seduced by -- a sexy, cherry-haired incarnation of the Qing dynasty god Tuer Shen, also known as the Rabbit God, the deity of homosexual love.Still from \"Kiss of the Rabbit God,\" a short film written and directed by Huang for Nowness. Starring Teddy Lee (left) and Jeff Chen (right). Credit: Courtesy Andrew Thomas HuangIn choosing the setting, Huang drew on his own life for the first time. He searched all over LA for a restaurant that would look like the one his Toisanese grandparents had once owned in Gardena, California, that his mother had helped run when Huang was growing up.The film flips between scenes of hectic restaurant work -- the heat and exhaustion of taking orders and clearing tables -- and hushed after-hours encounters between the protagonist and the Rabbit God. Huang takes what might have been a more typical story of immigrant hustle and dissolves it into a pool of erotic self-discovery.Uncertain timesThe pandemic has cast uncertainty over Huangs plans. After taking a family trip to China in 2019, Huang felt closer to his roots than ever, and he had been hoping to return. He had workshopped the \"Tiger Girl\" script at the Sundance Screenwriters and Directors Lab, and was finding momentum and community with \"a wave of ... my diasporic friends making really exciting work.\"And then Covid-19 hit. For now, hes fine-tuning the \"Tiger Girl\" script with a view to starting the casting process. But the forced pause in production has also provided Huang with time to consider what he hopes to accomplish with the movie.\"Tiger Girl\" will be, in some ways, a classic American story about a second-generation kid trying to navigate the pressures of parents and society. But Huang wants to evade cliche by avoiding a dreary, realist aesthetic, and instead use his signature mixed-media to depict characters inner worlds.Still from \"Lily Chan & The Doom Girls.\" Credit: Courtesy Andrew Thomas Huang\"I just dont see why these things are mutually exclusive -- why someones inner life cant be expressed with the same flair, effects and visuals as a big Hollywood movie,\" Huang said.\"I think, so much of the time, this arsenal of Hollywood production is used for very external stories of good versus evil. Im more interested in finding a symbolic language to talk about this stuff.\"Top image caption: Still from \"Lily Chan & The Doom Girls\" featuring Linda Ngo (left) and Hojo Shin (right).", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/andrew-thomas-huang-hyphenated/index.html"}, {"title": "Are we ready for our smart home devices to become truly \"smart\"?", "data_published": "2021-04-28T08:05:19Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNFor decades, the smart home has been a mainstay in pop culture, from Disneys 1999 flick \"Smart House,\" in which an artificially intelligent home takes on the personality of a domineering mother, to the retro high-tech home of \"The Jetsons.\" The 1960s cartoon offered a view of domestic life a century later, from a grooming room that combs your hair and brushes your teeth, to the ever-attentive and overworked Rosie, the robot maid.Some of the Jetsons housewares and furnishings, such as the bed that ejected the occupant like a piece of toast, are still a pipe dream. But 60 years later, weve got their smart watches and (comparatively primitive) digital assistants.In our homes, devices like Google Nest identify friends or strangers at the door, while Philips Hue lights can be programmed to shift their color based on our circadian clocks. When we plan meals for the week, Samsungs Family Hub refrigerator photographs whats left in the fridge and makes suggestions based on our diets. If there are unusual sounds in our homes (like the cat lazily knocking a drinking glass to the floor), Amazons Alexa alerts us. In 2020, Samsung also teased a forthcoming robot companion named Ballie , that can roll around like BB-8 from \"Star Wars\" and help operate our smart home devices.We may not have the living room of \"The Jetsons\" yet, but over the past decade, integrated smart devices have become a mainstay in our homes. Credit: leanza abucayan/cnnFor the most part, we still explicitly direct our devices on how best to serve us, but thats about to change, according to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Joseph A. Paradiso, who directs the MIT Media Labs Responsive Environments group.Just over two decades after the late venture capitalist Eli Zelkha and his team at Palo Alto Ventures introduced the concept of \"ambient intelligence,\" laying out a future in which electronics were ubiquitous, interconnected and responsive parts of our homes, were on the cusp of making their vision a reality. The exploding field of ambient technology promises innovative, intuitive electronics that fade into the background hum of our lives.\"Soon, youre going to have systems that will be proactive,\" Paradiso said in a video interview. Our devices are \"going to see and hear as we do, and theyre going to be suggesting and prompting.\"In 2018, Amazon waded into these waters with Alexas Hunches feature, which can perform small tasks, like turning off smart lights for you when you go to bed, without your direction. Until this January, users had to give permission for Alexa to act on her decisions. But now, once youve opted in, Alexa can decide what to do around your home based on your habits.\"Its a big change in your relationship with Alexa, if it starts to decide things for you,\" Sarah Housley, head of consumer technology at trend forecasting company WGSN, explained in a video interview.Amazons digital assistant Alexa can now make decisions for users based on their habits, thanks to an updated \"Hunches\" feature.As technology progresses, artificial intelligence (AI), the linchpin of ambient technology, will likely augment more areas of our lives. Any error, however, may lead to backlash, Housley warned.\"All it would take is for an intuitive AI system to make a bad decision that impacts badly on you or someone else. And then there would be a very quick kind of cultural conversation of whos to blame for the decisions that technology is making for them,\" Housley said, pointing to the debate that surrounded a fatal self-driving Uber accident back in 2018.And that conversation is bound to come soon: By 2030, WGSN has predicted that we will be using 50 billion connected devices around the world, creating smart networks in and outside of the home.The technology is now in line with the futurologistsJamie Cobb, director of industrial design group Map Project Office in London, believes the next five to 10 years will see an explosion in ambient technology, thanks to groundwork laid over the last decade. His team is interested in the new behaviors that this type of technology will enable and how we will live harmoniously with it, as Map outlined in a recent e-paper, \" The Future of Ambient Technology .\"\"The technology is now in line with the futurologists,\" Cobb said. A decade ago, he added, \"youd never (have) imagined that someone could order food or turn the lights on just by talking to an object, and thats quickly become part of a very familiar landscape.\"Some of the biggest advancements have been made in computing power, sensor size and speech and natural language recognition, according to Paradiso. But our devices are poised to respond to far more than voice commands. Ambient technology will be sensitive to our movement, gaze, posture, body language, heat biometrics, and the nuances in our tone of voice, Cobb said.At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2020, Panasonic unveiled a new concept based on activity-sensing technology that is designed to predict your behavior around the home, including biometric sensors that adjust room temperature based on your body heat. Chinese home appliance brand Haier, meanwhile, showcased a concept for a flexible and accessible kitchen that can adjust the height of appliances, among other features, by using voice and facial recognition to determine who is using it.Samsungs smart refrigerators can help people plan their meals based on their dietary needs, as well as whats left in their fridge. Other kitchen concepts imagine an even more personalized and automated experience. Credit: Michele Tantussi/Getty ImagesAmbient technology may help us rely less on screens, as we need them less to direct our devices. Our digital assistants can already access many of our apps for us without the need to swipe open our phones, and those types of interactions are bound to become more comprehensive.\"Its amazing how much screens have taken over my young childrens lives,\" Cobb said. \"Thats a very lean-forward, immersive experience. But when we talk about ambient, it gives us an opportunity to create more lean-back experiences.\"The technology may help run a more sustainable home. WGSNs \" The Future Home of 2030 \" report looked at new technology that could do just that, including VibroSense, an AI-powered device developed by researchers at Cornell University. Tracking vibrations in walls, ceilings and floors, VibroSense monitors and adjusts 17 different types of appliances in the home, turning off dripping faucets and alerting residents to the wet clothes left unattended in the washing machine.Though it does take energy to run smart devices, manufacturers have touted overall savings costs. According to Google, its Nest thermostat saves US customers up to 12% on heating and 15% on cooling bills.Devices like the Nest Learning Thermostat aim to run homes in a more sustainable way. Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Archive Photos/Getty ImagesThe WGSN report details how our living spaces will be increasingly digitized and able to change up visually or aurally according to our moods, using augmented reality (AR) and deep learning, which Housley suggests could lead to a creative boom when it comes to home decor. IKEA has provided a glimpse into what our homes might soon be capable of through its project \"Everyday Experiments\" with Danish design lab SPACE10, proposing blinds that adjust themselves according to the sun, or an AR and spatial audio app that turns the objects in your home into a musical symphony by scanning and assigning each of them a sound, which can be changed by rearranging objects, among other concepts.\"The idea that a designer can design a mood, or design an ambience is a fantastic thing,\" Housley said. \"So thinking about how all of the senses come together is going to be really inspiring for designers -- how do they pair lighting with color and with sound and with pattern and tactility?\"\"I think that digital decor could become a sustainable way to update your space, if you have furnishings that you can change digitally by projecting color or light onto them,\" she added.And, though it may have been too early for smart glasses when Google Glass was introduced back in 2013, a number of AR glasses on the horizon -- reportedly including Apple and Facebook -- will mean that soon enough, anything in or outside of the home may become interactive and responsive.Privacy in a world of intimate technologyBut all of this innovation could come at a cost: our privacy. And in the current landscape, its a fee consumers may be reticent to pay. \"With the big backlash against Big Tech that weve seen over the past few years, I think consumers... have a certain level of interest in privacy and ethics now that they didnt before,\" Housley said.These fears arent entirely unfounded. Massive breaches to major websites have compromised the data of hundreds of millions of people in the past few years, and the comprehensive data ambient technology relies on will include far more than our addresses and credit card numbers. The digital assistant that will be able to identify when youll be most attentive for a Spanish lesson -- a function Paradiso said is being heavily researched -- will have the type of information that could be used to manipulate you.\"We can start looking at your internal state: Are you focused? Is this the best time to give you this information now?\" Paradiso said. \"If you have intimate knowledge of people, you can start knowing exactly how to make an intervention to sway them.\"While we are now accustomed to hyper-targeted product advertising, the Cambridge Analytica scandal , which saw Facebook user data harvested and exploited for political advertising, portends a future where it may become much easier to use peoples personal preferences for much more than purchasing decisions.A decade ago, \"Youd never (have) imagined that someone could order food or turn the lights on just by talking to an object, and thats quickly become part of a very familiar landscape,\" Cobb said.

Amazon Sidewalk, for instance, will be rolling out soon, offering the ability to create smart neighborhoods by allowing connected devices to work beyond the range of a single homes Wi-Fi, including home security systems, broadening their potential reach.But Housley says technology meant to connect people also has the potential to exacerbate inequalities. She points out racial profiling that has taken place on some neighborhood social networking apps like Nextdoor as foreshadowing to what may follow. The app has been criticized for allowing users to report people they see in their neighborhood as \"suspicious\" based only on their race. The company has tried to address the issue with several features, including a new \" anti-racism notification \" that identifies offensive phrases and asks users to reconsider before they post.\"(The racism is) almost amplified by the technology... And so that will need to be tackled as well for consumers to feel like these systems are equitable and that theyre democratic.\"Identifying these problems will become crucial as more people opt in to relinquishing their tasks to ambient technology. In a world with billions and billions of connected devices that learn us intimately to streamline our lives, it will be harder to opt out.\"I think it will become more and more of a luxury to be unconnected,\" Housley said.But Paradiso takes a more optimistic tone, referring to sci-fi writers who have opined about the collective intelligence humans will be capable of when more fully linked.\"(Ambient technology) is going to really unite us with machine intelligence and each other, ideally, in a way, thats great,\" he said. \"I like to take the long view, and something like that would be wonderful.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/future-smart-home-ambient-technology/index.html"}, {"title": "A photographer tells her family's story about the dark side of an American dream", "data_published": "2021-03-09T10:10:19Z", "content": "Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written byFor 20 years, photographer Diana Markosian thought she knew her familys immigration history -- or the gist of it, at least. In 1996, when she was seven, Markosians mother, Svetlana, woke her and her older brother, David, in the middle of the night, telling them to pack all of their important things: the three of them were going to see America. The way Markosian remembers it, neither of them asked any questions. That night they boarded a plane in Moscow bound for Los Angeles, without saying goodbye to their father.Diana Markosian, My Parents Together, 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana MarkosianWhen they disembarked at the airport, the family was greeted by Eli, a pudgy, much-older, American friend of their mothers, who brought them into his home in coastal Santa Barbara. The trip, Markosian was told, was meant to be a holiday. But after Svetlana and Eli married less than a year later (they remained so for nine), Santa Barbara became home.\"When we came to America in the 90s, it felt like an absolute dream to be here. (My mom) fell in love with being an American, she embraced it,\" Markosian recalled in a phone interview. \"I am not sure my mom was leaving anything behind. Everything had already been taken.\"Even before they lived there, Markosian had been aware of some version of Santa Barbara. The 1980s American soap opera of the same name was the first TV show of its kind to be broadcast in post-Soviet Russia, and her mother was among the millions of Russians who made \"Santa Barbara\" a hit , escaping into a world that felt exciting, exotic and far-removed from their own.After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Svetlana, an economist, and her husband Arsen, an engineer -- Armenians who emigrated to Moscow to finish their doctorates, and separated before Markosian was born -- were living in poverty, amid widespread unemployment and hyperinflation. Arsen hawked Matryoshka dolls in Red Square and sold homemade Barbie dresses across Moscow to make ends meet. Svetlana assisted him with his bootleg Barbie business, and waited in the bread lines for handouts to feed the family.Diana Markosian, Moscow Breadline, 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana MarkosianBut in January 2017, when Markosian was 27, that narrative was disrupted. As the newly ascended President Trump enacted his first travel ban, Markosian, who was then working as a photojournalist for the likes of National Geographic and the New Yorker, began pressing her mother about their own immigration story.\"I just started talking about it and trying to understand: How did we even manage to do this? How did we manage to come to America? And I saw [my mother had] this real desire to tell me, and this readiness to reveal something that felt so shameful, so difficult to tell me. And thats kind of how it came about\" Markosian said.In reality, Svetlana, enamored with the vision of America shed seen on TV, had met Eli through an ad shed had circulated in American newspapers and magazines through a Russian agency that matched Soviet women with American men -- a popular route for women looking to immigrate at the time. Her proposition was simple: \"I am a young woman from Moscow, and would like to meet a kind man who can show me America.\" Her first husband had had no idea she was looking to move, and was blindsided when she flew across the world with his children and severed communication. (When she was 22, Markosian and her brother tracked her father down during a trip to Armenia. He had returned to Yerevan, the capital, where the family had lived when Markosian was a child.)Markosian was stunned. \"You hold your parents up on a pedestal and I think, for me, there was this anger, (this feeling) that this cant be our story. Why didnt I know more about this? Why wasnt I included in this decision?\" she said. \"Its not just us coming to America and living an American life. Its us coming to America, keeping this secret of where we are for 20 years, and of not seeing my father for 20 years. Its completely abandoning our past for this dream.\"Diana Markosian, The Disappointment, 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana MarkosianTo help her process the revelation, and learn to empathize with her mothers decision to abandon her life in Moscow, Markosian set out to reenact her familys journey on camera, through a short film and an accompanying photo series titled \"Santa Barbara.\" Shot from her mothers perspective, the project saw her auditioning hundreds of actors to play her family members (she looked at 384 women before she found an actor to play Svetlana, someone \"who would understand what it meant to give up everything for this one decision\"), and shooting in locations across California, as well as the familys former apartment in Yerevan . (The current tenants allowed her to rent the space.) Ana Imnadze, the actor who plays Svetlana, even wears pieces from her mothers wardrobe; Armen Margaryan, who plays Arsen, wears her fathers watch.\"I started seeing it as a story, and trying to divorce myself from my own life,\" she said. \"It needed to be a work of fiction, almost, for me to accept it, to process it, to fall in love with it. Because otherwise, it just felt too, too painful.\"The photos that comprise \"Santa Barbara\" are a careful mix of the cinematic and the personal, fantasy and reality. There are dramatically framed domestic scenes, moodily lit (nodding to the dark Americana of Gregory Crewdson and David Lynch ), and overexposed snapshots, including one that shows her \"father\" holding out a birthday cake, a still life with cigarettes and a cherry-red rotary phone, which looks like its been borrowed from a family scrapbook.Palm Springs, from Santa Barbara, 2020 © Diana Markosian, courtesy the artist Credit: Courtesy Diana MarkosianSimilarly, Markosian said the accompanying film, running about 15 minutes, \"relies on all these different formats to kind of understand a chapter in my familys life.\" Recreated moments from Russia and California are intercut with Super 8 videos and photos from Markosians childhood, as well as auditioning actors screen tests. Much of the dialogue is organic: At various points, Svetlana is interrogated by her doppelganger, dressed as her younger self, over the dinner table; and Markosian and Svetlana have their own back-and-forth in voiceover.Markosian had originally intended for the project to be scripted. She even recruited one of the original writers from \"Santa Barbara,\" Lynda Myles, to pen a script, and gave her family the opportunity to edit it. In part, this was a way to mitigate her own anxiety about telling a story in which she felt like a bit player.Diana Markosian, The Wedding, 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana Markosian\"The hardest part of this project was coming to terms with the fact that I was the narrator,\" she said \"I sometimes sit with that thought and think why me? I was the youngest person in the room; I really didnt have a voice in any of the decisions that were made. Why am I the one whos in the place to tell this story? \"It was a collective memory, and we all had our own version.\"But finding a version of events that her family could agree on -- from the nuances of Arsen and Svetlanas relationship, to the realities of life in California -- proved impossible. She brought Myles script to her father in Armenia, giving him the opportunity to inject his own perspective, but when she returned to California, her mother ended up crossing out his words and replacing them with her own. The process repeated when she handed the script to her brother.Hearst Castle, from Santa Barbara, 2020 © Diana Markosian, courtesy the artist Credit: Courtesy Diana Markosian\"The whole thing is disputed (but) I think we reached a place of understanding that we were never going to really agree on any of it. (The differences were) not so dramatic that I couldnt put out a project, but enough that I started to understand how fascinating memory is, and that if I leaned into the gray, if I leaned into every perspective, I would arrive at a closer version of the truth than just this one version that I called my own,\" Markosian said. \"I looked at the script (after everyone had added their notes), and it became a piece of art in itself.\"Diana Markosian, The Argument , 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana Markosian\"I remember how special it was to come to America, and I never took that for granted.

But the field has, for centuries, been driven by medical necessity -- and it has nothing to do with plastic.The discipline derives its name from the Greek word \"plastikos\" -- to mold or give form. And while the idea of perfecting yourself surgically is a relatively recent phenomenon, there is evidence of reconstructive surgery going back to antiquity.The oldest-known procedures appear in an ancient Egyptian medical text called the \"Edwin Smith Papyrus.\" Thought to be an early trauma surgery textbook (and named after the American Egyptologist who purchased it in 1862), the treatise contains detailed case studies for a variety of injuries and diagnoses.As well as showing how the Egyptians treated wounds and bone fractures, the papyrus revealed a suggested fix for nasal injuries: manipulating the nose into the desired position before using wooden splints, lint, swabs and linen plugs to hold it in place. The Egyptians occasionally used prosthetics, too: In 2000, an ancient mummy was found to have a prosthetic toe that may have aided the womans walking, according to researchers who tested replicas of the toe on modern-day volunteers.An illustration depicting 19th-century plastic surgery being performed on a woman with facial burns. Credit: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty ImagesWhether these procedures can be considered types of plastic surgery is a matter of historical debate, according to Justin Yousef, whose research on the topic was recently published in the European Journal of Plastic Surgery. It is in India, in fact, that historians have found \"the first description of reconstruction proper,\" he said in a phone interview.By the 6th century B.C., physicians in India were carrying out procedures not dissimilar to a modern-day cosmetic rhinoplasty. In a detailed compendium called \"Sushruta Samhita,\" the Indian physician Sushruta -- who is sometimes called the father of plastic surgery -- outlined a remarkably advanced technique for skin grafts.As in Egypt, the procedure involved repairing noses. But according to Yousef, patients motives were, in a sense, cosmetic.\"In ancient India, there was a practice of having ones nose removed as punishment for adulterous acts or (other acts that were) against the law at the time,\" said Yousef, who is also a trainee surgeon at Sydneys Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. \"It was a public sign of shame -- if you walked around with an absent nose, people knew that youd done something.\"Sushrutas technique involved constructing new noses using skin from elsewhere on patients faces. \"There are two schools of thought,\" Yousef said. \"That the skin was either from the forehead or the cheek. But he basically raised the skin and the underlying fat, before transporting it to the area of the nose.\"Elsewhere in antiquity, the first known cleft lip repair is believed to have been successfully carried out by 4th-century Chinese doctors. And in ancient Rome, the encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus documented a procedure whereby excess skin around patients eyes was surgically removed\"Celsus described what we today would call blepharoplasty, or eyelid rejuvenation,\" Yousef said. \"It was used when hairs (eyelashes) became inverted and started to affect the patients ability to see. They were trying to shorten the eyelid so the hairs wouldnt reach the eye.\"In the ancient world, patients were usually \"seeking to replace something rather than enhance their aesthetic appeal,\" Yousef said. And given the pain and risks involved, going under the knife was reserved for those most in need. \"Wine was the anesthetic,\" Yousef added.The needs of warProgress in the field was slow over the ensuing centuries. Like much of medical science, it was the development of modern germ theory and the 19th-century invention of anesthesia that began shaping the practices seen today.As with so many innovations, however, there was another factor that accelerated plastic surgerys progress: war.During World War I, the sheer volume of patients with facial injuries -- coupled with advances in blood transfusions and infection control -- allowed doctors to experiment with innovative new techniques, according to Andrew Bamji, author of \" Faces from the Front ,\" a book tracing the origins of modern plastic surgery.\"If youve got 100 patients to learn from, that actually isnt very many, given the various types of injuries you can have,\" the writer and retired rheumatologist said in a phone interview. \"But if youve got 5,000 patients, its a different game altogether.\"A doctor examines a patient at the maxillofacial Center of Marie Lannelongue Hospital in Paris. Headed by doctor Maurice Virenque, the hospital has been a pioneer of reconstructive surgery in the 20th century. Credit: AFP/Getty ImagesThe institution at the heart of Bamjis book, Queen Marys Hospital in London, was the \"first to concentrate all the patients in one place,\" he added. Skin grafts, bone grafts, facial reconstructions and wound-stitching techniques all made dramatic leaps forward.\"Youve got literally dozens of surgeons working there, and they can bounce ideas off each other. We have photographs of two operations happening in the same operating theater at once -- which from a cross-infection point of view, nowadays, would be completely forbidden -- but... you have this incredible interchange of ideas and the development of reconstructive techniques.\"At the time, the priority for military and civilian patients was improved functioning, such as chewing or breathing more easily. And the idea of using surgery to simply improve ones appearance remained in its infancy. Doctors in Europe and America had experimented with rudimentary cosmetic procedures prior to World War I, though they were \"hit and miss,\" Bamji said, adding that \"quite a lot of it went wrong.\"At the start of the 20th century in France, for instance, doctors sometimes attempted to re-contour patients faces using paraffin wax. Although solid at room temperature, when the wax warmed in the body \"it started to melt, and so it sank into the lower regions,\" Bamji said.Standards improved in the inter-war period, which also saw the first attempts at sex reassignment surgery. But cosmetic procedures were frowned upon by parts of the medical establishment. In the 1930s, some surgeons \"bobbed noses and performed some breast operations,\" Dr. Richard L. Dolsky wrote in the American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery in 1999, although \"such work occurred quietly, without fanfare.\"\"Most plastic surgeons yearned to be recognized as serious surgeons and avoided what were considered frivolous procedures,\" he added.Entering the mainstreamThe post-war period saw drastic changes for the field. Improved technology, diminished risk and increased disposable income all contributed to plastic surgerys growing popularity -- as did a surplus of doctors after the end of World War II, according to Bamji.\"Youve got all these plastic surgeons that havent got anything else to do,\" he said. \"Once they were done with all the wartime causalities, of which there were vast numbers, then they can get on with all these other things.\"By the 1960s -- in the US especially -- many of todays most common cosmetic procedures, such as breast augmentation, rhinoplasty and face re-shaping, were becoming more commonplace. Innovation was still driven by the needs of trauma patients or those suffering from cancer or disfigurements. But the technology could be used to vainer ends.A patient recieves botox injections at a Philadelphia hospital in 2002. Credit: Don Murray/Getty ImagesTake, for instance, the emergence of Botox. Originally a treatment for strabismus, or crossed eyes, in the late 1960s and 1970s , the injections were later harnessed by the cosmetics industry for their skin-smoothing properties and were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat frown lines in 2002. (In recent years, innovation has benefited the medical profession once again, with Botox now used to treat migraines and spasms. Just last year, a study found that the injections may help alleviate depression, with the authors hypothesizing that paralyzing facial muscles disrupts the feedback loop between negative facial expressions and negative emotions.)It took a plastic surgery explosion boom of the 1990s, which saw the volume of procedures in America grow tenfold , for cosmetic procedures to begin outnumber reconstructive ones. By 2005, the number of cosmetic surgery procedures performed in the US was almost double that of reconstructive procedures, according to data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, or ASPS. Fueled by celebrity endorsements and economies of scale, cosmetic surgery also tapped into a new aesthetic of desirability, said Ruth Holliday, a professor of gender and culture at Leeds Universitys School of Sociology and Social Policy.\"Post-feminist thinking, which first emerged in the 1980s, was all about showing how empowered you were,\" she recently told CNN . \"It was about women reclaiming their sexuality, both from the patriarchy and the feminist movement itself. Within the realm of plastic surgery, that translated into emphasizing all the parts of their bodies that were already widely eroticized by society -- thighs, curves, breasts -- to own and show off their femininity.\"According ASPS data , 15.6 million cosmetic procedures were carried out in the US last year. New technology continues to drive the sectors growth, with some 85% of these procedures (of which Botox and fillers were by far the most popular) considered \"minimally invasive.\"Tastes continue to change, too. And while the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the entire industry, with ASPS reporting a 15% drop in cosmetic procedures carried out in the US in 2020 compared to the previous year, some procedures suffered far larger falls -- the number of breast augmentations was down 33% and buttock lifts were down 27%, year over year.Patients await a check-up after a plastic surgery procedure at a clinic in Tirana, Albania. Credit: Gent Shkullaku/AFP/Getty ImagesIt remains to be seen whether the so called \" Zoom effec t\" (or \"Zoom boom\") will be reflected in 2021s figures. But a number of surgeons and clinics have reported an increased demand for surgery on those body parts most visible during video calls -- neck liposuctions, lower facelifts and under-eye fillers.Dr. Sheila Nazarian, star of Netflix reality show \"Skin Decision,\" said in a phone interview last year that, when her Beverly Hills clinic reopened after Californias lockdown, \"lots of people came to get lower face work ... because, with Zoom, the camera points up from below.\"\"People started thinking about doing things that would make them feel good in the long-term.\"Top image: A physician and patient at Moscows Beauty Institute cosmetology clinic in 1968.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/plastic-cosmetic-surgery-history-scn/index.html"}, {"title": "How the late night talk show set became an American icon", "data_published": "2021-05-07T11:55:32Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNFor more than six decades, American late night talk show hosts have sat behind large wooden desks, with guests in cushioned chairs or couches to their right. Behind them, the wall may be painted to mimic an open vista; around them, a brightly lit studio set is made more inviting through warm wood tones, mugs on a desk or -- in Johnny Carsons case -- a couple of well-placed house plants.As much as the programs themselves are part of Americans nightly rituals, the late night talk show set has become an iconic -- and predictable -- fixture in television, today inhabited by comics including Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, following in the lineage of Jay Leno and David Letterman, and further back, Carson, Steve Allen and Dick Cavett.Johnny Carson (pictured with Dolly Parton) remains televisions longest-running late night talk show host, spending four decades behind the desk for \"The Tonight Show.\" Credit: Alice S.

But an American living room where one of the people, the owner of the living room, sits behind a desk.\"When it was first introduced around 1949, late night was a different beast than the already familiar entertainment of evening variety like \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" or daytime talk show programming like \"The Today Show.\" The late show concept had a very low bar for success, as the CNN original series \"The Story of Late Night,\" details. Prior to the debut of the then-novel, post-11pm programming, the nightly news would give way to a test pattern, and then static -- a foreign visual today, in an era when there is always something to stream.Watch a brief history of late night talk shows\"Late night began as a way to kill time,\" host Conan OBrien, who just announced the end of his long-running program on TBS, said in the docuseries. \"It was the networks realizing... lets kick the football a little further down the road and see what happens at 11:30.\"Today, late night talk shows have branched out beyond network television, and have begun to include more women and hosts of color, including new shows helmed by Seth Meyers writer Amber Ruffin and popular YouTuber Lilly Singh.Yet the desk setup largely remains, and its notable when a host tries to do away with the formula -- like when Bill Maher sat among his guests on the 90s show \"Politically Incorrect.\" Last year, Samantha Bee explained the reason her weekly show \"Full Frontal\" is deskless in an interview for the Television Academy Foundation, saying the traditional approach made her feel \"super confined.\"Comedian Steve Allen first introduced the talk show desk during the often experimental 1950s show \"Tonight Starring Steve Allen\" -- the first iteration of \"The Tonight Show.\" Credit: NBC/Getty ImagesStill, the spirit of the 1950s and 60s era of set design has largely persisted.\"Every time you see a late night show, it seems like everybody starts with the same formula,\" said Keith Raywood, a production designer who has built sets for OBrien and Fallon, in a video interview. \"They just dress it differently.\"Designed for power dynamicsThe pioneer of the late night talk show was actually a woman, the actress Faye Emerson, who hosted interviews and gave her own political commentary in 1949 on \"The Faye Emerson Show,\" often from a couch in a living room. But then women were relegated to the realm of daytime television, where advertisers could appeal to stay-at-home wives, media historian Maureen Mauk explained in \"The Story of Late Night.\"\"The men started to take over (late night), and the women were really never to return, in a lot of ways,\" Mauk said. (The next female host to nab a nighttime talk show was Joan Rivers in 1986, but Fox cancelled \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\" the following year. A decade later, Cynthia Garrett became the first network late night Black female host, but her NBC show \"Later\" was axed after a single season.)Joan Rivers was often a guest host for Carson on \"The Tonight Show,\" as pictured here with Oprah Winfrey, but wound up competing against him with her own short-lived Fox show. Credit: Paul Drinkwater/NBC/Getty ImagesComedian Steve Allen first introduced the desk during his wacky and experimental programming that was the first iteration of \"The Tonight Show\" -- which included him dipping into vats of jello and happily pie-smashing his guests. According to \"The Story of Late Night,\" Allens successor, Jack Paar, added the content format were still familiar with today: a monologue, interview and performance.But it was Johnny Carson, host of \"The Tonight Show\" for over four decades, whose affable, family-friendly charm became synonymous with late night. And his long-running show also cemented the hierarchy implicit in the layout of the set.\"The desk is occasionally breached,\" said Thompson. During the first taping of the \"Late Show with David Letterman,\" Bill Murray spray painted Lettermans desk. Credit: Alan Singer/CBS/Getty Images\"Its less democratic, less egalitarian, if someone is sitting behind a desk in an elevated position, and his guests are not equal in stature in terms of how theyre being seated,\" Raywood said.Thompson points out the setup \"leaves the guests to be fully exposed.\" Cavett, whose talk show slots included late night, preferred to sit more casually on comfortable chairs with his guests, putting them on equal ground.Arsenio Hall (here with Eddie Murphy) shook up late night as the first Black host -- and notably did away the desk format. Credit: Ron Galella, Ltd./Getty ImagesBut one magnetic personality aimed for an even more personal way of engaging with his guests. Arsenio Hall, who in 1989 became the first Black host to helm a late night talk show, sat close to his guests, who were on a couch, and leaned in with rapt attention.\"We see him in his entirety,\" Thompson said of Hall. \"He would lean into his interviews...which gave it a sense of intimacy.\"Carson, on the other hand, \"had an emotional distance to him,\" Thompson said. \"The idea of him leaning in in that friendly, familiar way that Arsenio did would have been unthinkable. And I think its one of the reasons (\"The Arsenio Hall Show\") really had some voltage and some energy -- because it looked less like what we had seen so many times over and over again.\"Reworking the formulaSome of the most creative takes on talk show sets have come out of the parodies, which have become as ubiquitous as late night itself.The original spoof, Norman Lears \"Fernwood 2 Night\" from 1977, and its grandchild, Zach Galifianakiss \"Between Two Ferns,\" which premiered in 2008, directly referenced the ever-present greenery on Carsons set. President Obama was famously tapped for Galifianakiss Funny or Die series, which took place on a simple black set with two towering green ferns. During his interview, Obama deadpanned to the comedian: \"When I heard that people actually watch this show, I was actually pretty surprised.\"Eric Andre and Semere Etmet at \"The Eric Andre Show Live!\" The sketch comedy series parodies public-access talk shows with a wild dose of surrealism.

Its only recently that another substantial shift in late night set design has occurred, he said, thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which forced late night hosts to tape from home for an extended period of time.\"All of a sudden, the set of the talk show itself was totally downsized, because people were doing it from home,\" he said. \"Colbert started in his bathtub the very first day.\"As Colbert suited up in his bubble bath the first night for \"The Late Show\" on CBS, Meyers posted up at his in-laws house for \"Late Night\" on NBC. After 68 episodes there, a painting of a sea captain, which had become an animated \"guest\" throughout the remote shows, said goodbye with a jaunty sea shanty.Late-night TV marks anniversary of pandemic\"In a strange way, the liberation from those Carson-era studio sets was actually, creatively, a good thing for late night talk shows,\" Thompson said.Instead of guests stopping by the set, they could dial in from wherever, using Zoom backgrounds or sharing the intimacy of their homes.\"Sometimes its more interesting to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger from his house, than it is to have Arnold Schwarzenegger wander onto the stage, which is so artificial, so prepped,\" Thompson said.Raywood also signaled that its time for something new, after nearly seven decades of following the same formula.\"I think we could easily be due for a change in format for late night television,\" he said. \"Every generation veers into another direction -- how they look at things, how they dress, the kind of music they listen to -- so why are we doing the same show every (time)?\"He added: \"You need producers who are creative enough, and brave enough.\"This article has been updated to correct the title and year of Joan Rivers late-night show with Fox, and to include additional context regarding the Dick Cavett set.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/late-night-set-design-history/index.html"}, {"title": "From Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls", "data_published": "2021-04-21T09:53:28Z", "content": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNNArchitectural photographer Arthur Drooker is well aware of the reputation held by Americas city halls. After all, the subjects of his latest project are so closely associated with bureaucracy they have inspired the despairing aphorism, \"You cant fight city hall.\"\"Most people have probably never gone into their city hall unless they absolutely had to, whether that was to pay a tax bill, pull permits for construction, vote on election day or attend a hearing,\" Drooker said in a video interview. \"But the more memorable ones are beautiful buildings you just want to visit just for their own sake.\"Over the course of four years, Drooker traveled to around 40 of Americas 300-plus city halls. Often spending days at each, he documented their grand exteriors, explored long-forgotten corners and spoke to local politicians and architects about how the institutions operate. The resulting images reveal a surprisingly rich variety of styles, from Flemish Renaissance Revival in Milwaukee to Art Deco in Saint Paul, Minnesota.Los Angeles City Hall as seen from the Walt Disney Concert Hall, another of the citys architectural icons. Credit: Courtesy Arthur DrookerUnlike many federal buildings, city halls were often designed to reflect the places they represent. For instance, in Californias Palm Springs, famous for its Modernist villas , Drooker found a low-rise mid-century city hall complete with palm trees growing through a circular opening in the canopy above its entranceway.In New York state, meanwhile, the halls of Buffalos soaring Art Deco city hall are painted with murals nodding to the regions industries and decorative tiles inspired by Native American motifs.By choosing just 15 of the countrys most architecturally eye-catching examples, the photographers new book \" City Hall \" is neither exhaustive nor strictly representative. (He filtered out buildings he found dull during his research, and some of the shortlisted buildings he visited proved \"disappointing\" in person.) Yet, as a selective survey, the photos instead show what cities can achieve when political will, financial resources and visionary design converge.\"Those three things, working together, can make a building that transcends its function,\" Drooker said.Changing face of powerDespite the buildings apparent diversity, Neoclassicism has, historically, reigned large in American civic life. It has always been the \"default architecture,\" of government, Drooker said.\"They have the Greek-style columns, the pediments and the steps leading up to it because it conveys, very quickly, that this is an important building -- theres power in this building.\"Milwaukee City Hall was build in the Flemish Renaissance Revival style at the end of the 19th century.

Donald Trumps 2020 executive order requiring all new federal buildings to be built on \"the forms, principles and vocabulary of the architecture of Greek and Roman antiquity\" may have been overturned by his successor -- and would not, in any case, have applied to city halls -- but it exposed a disdain for contemporary architecture that exists in parts of government and elsewhere.For Drooker, however, modern city halls not only reflect evolving tastes but changing expressions of power. Their designs suggest that the way rulers present themselves to the ruled has shifted in the 200 years between his books oldest case study, New Yorks Federal-style city hall, and its most recent, Las Vegas City Hall, which was completed less than a decade ago and is wrapped in an LED-enabled glass facade.\"City halls are now consciously designed to be more open and more welcoming,\" Drooker said, offering San Joses, completed in 2005, as an example. \"It has a plaza thats open to the street, and the architects of the building wanted to think of it as the citys living room.\"San José City Hall, opened in 2005, features a modern take on the classic rotunda seens in many of Americas historic civic buildings. Credit: Courtesy Arthur DrookerThe photographers inclusion of two Brutalist buildings -- namely the seemingly austere Boston City Hall and Dallas inverted concrete pyramid by late architect I.M. Pei -- might appear to contradict this correlation between modernity and openness. Brutalism, which was singled out for criticism by Trumps aforementioned executive order, is often maligned for being cold and uncaring. Yet, for Drooker, there is an unexpected transparency to these designs.\"A lot of people -- I dare say including me -- dont think of Brutalism as especially welcoming,\" he admitted. \"But the architects of Boston City Hall were very clear that they wanted this building to be open to the people, because Boston was coming out of a very corrupt period, politically.\"It was basically a stripped-down concrete building, as if to say: We have nothing to hide, it is what it is. It is a very permeable building that is very open to the street, so this (reflects the idea of) consciously designing buildings that are open and available to the people they serve.\"Local democracy at workThe photographers personal fascination with city halls began with his local one, in San Francisco. \"I would visit two or three times a week, and just take photos with my iPhone then post them on Instagram,\" Drooker recalled.Rebuilt after its predecessor was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, San Francisco City Hall is a notable remnant of the City Beautiful movement, which sought to reimagine Americas cities at the turn of the 20th century. The striking Beaux-Arts design features a pink Tennessee marble staircase leading to an ornate rotunda and a 307-foot dome -- the nations tallest -- painted with gold leaf.Local references feature prominently in Buffalos Art Deco design, opened in 1932.

In one image, a crack is seen running along the rotundas marble floor, a reminder of the 1989 earthquake that almost threatened to repeat history.Indeed, while the photographer is primarily concerned with architecture, his images are often acts of symbolism, too, whether focusing on a Los Angeles ceiling panel that alludes to the citys moviemaking heritage or a gavel in New York council chamber, worn from years of passing judgement. It is a fitting approach a project that, according to Drooker, was not just about documenting the buildings but checking the pulse of local government.\"Part of me felt like I was on a mission to create a manifesto for democracy,\" he said. \"Because democratic ideals are baked into these buildings, whether its a quote on the wall or a city council chamber designed to be welcoming to the general public.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/arthur-drooker-city-hall-photos/index.html"}, {"title": "The Native American couple redefining cultural norms -- in photos", "data_published": "2021-02-03T09:58:16Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNChallenging binaries and stereotypes, \"Swing\" is a pop-up series that paints a nuanced portrait of America through photography of the day-to-day lives of overlooked people and communities.In the summer of 2019, as an overcast sky hung over Minnesotas Prairie Island Indian Community, photographer and filmmaker Tomás Karmelo Amaya took a portrait of a couple kissing while wearing colorful regalia.The couple, Nevada-based dancers Adrian Matthias Stevens and Sean Snyder, were visiting the reservation to dance in the Tinta Wita Wacipi powwow, a tradition that brought them together -- and a tradition in which they are now making history.Two-Spirit couple Adrian Matthias Stevens and Sean Snyder are changing cultural expectations through dance.

Within North American Indigenous communities, Two-Spirit refers to people who possess both masculine and feminine spirits, but it can also be used to represent LGBTQ+ Indigenous people more broadly.\"Its not biological, its spiritual, and it ties back to what I was taught growing up,\" Stevens told Vogue in 2020. \"My aunties recognized me as a Two-Spirit individual way before I even recognized it.\"Stevens is a grass dancer and Snyder is a fancy dancer, but the two began competing in \"sweetheart special\" categories together, mixing both their styles.

When Stevens and Snyder met, they were both dancers on Utahs powwow circuit but it took years for them to perform couples routines -- called \"sweetheart specials\" -- together. That category was exclusively performed by male and female dancers until 2018, when they became the first Two-Spirit pair to do so, after being disqualified from a dance the year prior.\"Because our styles are so different, we had to find a way to dance together,\" Snyder is quoted as saying in Vogue . \"And for us being two men, it was surprisingly difficult. You dont grow up going to dances and learning to dance with another same-sex partner. We had to learn how to lead and how to take direction.\"Since then, their routines and matching regalia -- each embellished with their own handmade beadwork -- have brought them widespread attention. In 2019, a short documentary telling their story, \"Sweetheart Dancers,\" was shown at the PBS Short Film Festival.Tomás Karmelo Amaya shows the beauty of the dancers movements and their bond with each other against a stormy sky.

Because this is the type of safe environment we need to create for our youth and for our future ancestors, as well as a lot of our community members who have faced a lot of discrimination and oppression, and because of systems that are constantly negating their existence.\"Creating visual medicineIt was dance that brought Amaya and the Two-Spirit couple together. After a shoot in another part of the state, Amaya and his wife and business partner, Siera Begaye, decided to drive to the powwow in Prairie Island. Begaye, who also dances, had previously met Stevens and Snyder, and Amaya photographed the couple while they were waiting to hear the results of the categories they had performed in separately that day.Amaya calls his images \"visual medicine,\" believing photography has the power to heal.

I know the intention is there,\" he said. \"And then there are moments like receiving a message from a community member saying, This particular photo made me feel seen, it made me feel safe.

To most, the pervading image of wrestling may still be beefed-up, baby-oiled behemoths like Hulk Hogan or John Cena competing in staged fights, or the over-the-top, spandex-clad comedy theatrics seen in Netflixs hit series \"Glow.\"Pro wrestlings merits as a legitimate sport have long been debated, but can this curious confluence of kitsch characters and Cirque du Soleil-style acrobatics be considered art? In the 1950s, French philosopher Roland Barthes wrote an essay likening wrestling to theater -- the staged spectacles acted out in the ring presenting an allegory for good versus evil. In modern day, critics have compared wrestlings dramatic storylines to the televised soap opera, itself an extension of theater.Pro wrestling has always been known for its kitschy theatrical violence, but does it have artistic merit? Credit: George Napolitano/Orange CrushAdam Abdalla, the lead creative behind art and wrestling journal Orange Crush, said that in the past, hes brought visual artist friends to watch wrestling shows with him. \"(They) have told me, This is better than any performance art that Ive been to, because of just how visceral it is, the way wrestlers put their bodies on the line and just the choreography of it,\" he explained in a telephone interview.A wrestling and art journal might seem niche, but Abdalla has so far published two issues of the annual, which feels more akin to an indie culture publication than the highly saturated pages of a conventional wrestling magazine. The latest issue features thoughtful pieces on intergender wrestling -- contests between men and women -- and the contemporary artist Raymond Pettibons secret love affair with the sport.Raymond Pettibon is just one of the artists featured in \"Orange Crush,\" a new journal about art and wrestling. Credit: Raymond Pettibon/David Zwirner/Orange Crush\"If I go to people who might not be interested in wrestling, I did this journal, they go, Oh, this is cool, this is eccentric,\" Abdalla said. \"And I wanted to open wrestling fans eyes to the scope of how people incorporate the visual language of wrestling into contemporary culture.\"Creative risk-takingWrestling is a well from which wider culture has long drawn, but has given little credit. Take, for example, Hollywood plucking Dwayne Johnson from the wrestling ring and ascending him to the top of the box office, or wrestling serving as the premise for \"Glow\" and the new NBC series \"Young Rock.\"\"Wrestling does take artistic chances to tell a story,\" said \"Orange Crush\" creative lead Adam Abdalla. Credit: Michael Watson/Orange CrushAbdalla sees wrestling as an artistic and cultural force because of the sports willingness to take creative risks. \"I watched a match with Kazuyuki Fujita and Go Shiozaki of (Japanese wrestling company) Pro Wrestling Noah where they stared into each others eyes for 31 minutes without moving. And there was no audience --youre watching these guys stare each other down in complete silence,\" Abdalla said. \"Wrestling does take artistic chances to tell a story. That reminded me of (Serbian performance artist) Marina Abramovic.\"Its this artistry and the eclectic assortment of athletes who make up wrestling that Orange Crush spotlights. The cover star of the latest edition is Jon Moxley, a former WWE wrestler who broke away from the global platform of WWE television programs like \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" to exercise more creative freedom over his career. The photographs of Moxley, shot by wrestling photographer Ryan Loco, smoking a cigar and wielding a bottle of Jack Daniels backstage after a match are immediately arresting.Jon Moxley is the latest cover star of \"Orange Crush.\" Credit: Ryan Nixon/Orange Crush\"WWE is not great at portraying people as stars in a way that resonates with youth culture or popular culture,\" Abdalla said. \"I want these people to look like the stars that they are.\"\"A lot of wrestlers are very hip, have great taste in music and are interested in art and theyre not really given that platform,\" he added. \"Here they can express themselves in a unique way.\"Art world presence\"Orange Crush\" also gives a unique outlet to artists who harbor a passion for the wrestling ring.

Occasionally, she painted nude men as well, bucking art historical tradition and presenting them as figures of desire. Her canvases were full of bold outlines, vibrant colors and loose brushwork, and she deftly illustrated her subjects interior lives, rather than the idealized scenes of leisure so prevalent at the time.Championed by some of her most famous contemporaries, including Edgar Degas and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Valadon was no minor artist, and one of the few women painters of the era to receive critical acclaim. Yet, like many women artists of the 20th century, her fame faded after her death.Suzanne Valadon was a famous artists model who posed for Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec before striking out on her own to paint. Credit: Bettmann Archive/Getty ImagesBut today, curators and art historians are taking a second look at Valadons works, and reconsidering her life with more nuance. This September, the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia will stage her first major institutional show in the US, positioning her as an important yet underrecognized modern artist.From the start, Valadon was a controversial figure in Paris thriving art scene at the turn of the century, known as much for her bohemian attitudes and provocative personal life as her distinct, rebellious vision.Valadons paintings featured contemporary women with body hair, curves and a strong sense of self, diverging from the delicate femininity and timelessness favored in art. Pictured: \"Nude on the Sofa,\" 1920. Credit: Suzanne Valadon\"People were quite scandalized by her lifestyle,\" said Nancy Ireson, deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the Barnes Foundation. \"The fact that she had a younger lover; the fact that her son (the artist Maurice Utrillo), who was a famous painter, was also an alcoholic.\"This is over 100 years ago, but Im sure that women still face the same kinds of criticisms these days. How do you balance a successful career with being a good wife and a good mother?\"She understood how to performIn 1865, Suzanne Valadon was born Marie-Clémentine Valadon to an impoverished single mother in Montmartre. In her 2017 biography, \"Renoirs Dancer,\" Catherine Hewitt describes the young artist as a headstrong, imaginative child who exasperated the nuns trying to teach her. Valadon held a series of short-lived menial jobs before training as a circus performer at 15 years old, but her career was cut short by a back injury sustained during a trapeze stunt.Valadon will receive her first major US show at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia this fall, a century after she began receiving critical acclaim for her work. Pictured: \"Nude Sitting on a Sofa,\" 1916. Credit: The Weisman & Michel CollectionIt was during her recovery that Valadon began to draw. Lacking the training or money typically needed to enter the art world, she began modeling for artists. It was a salacious job, considered to be on par with sex work at the time, but one that offered her direct access to the art milieu of Paris.Valadon slipped into the new role with ease, serving as painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes model for more than seven years. In works by lesser-known artists, she transformed into figures of allegory and myth: the sultry Greek siren in a Gustav Wertheimer canvas, the feminine embodiment of truth for Czech painter Vojtĕch Hynais, always with her auburn hair as her calling card.Valadon was a female artist from a low-income background with no formal training, making her entry into the art world unheard of at the time. Pictured: \"Joy of Life,\" 1911. Credit: Sepia Times/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesHer reputation spread through word of mouth, as well as her determination to socialize and network in spaces exclusive to male artists, particularly the smoky, absinthe-steeped rooms of Parisian cafe culture. Soon Valadon was populating the works of some of the most famous Impressionist painters of the time. Most famously, she danced across Renoirs scenes of societal leisure, in \"Dance in the City\" and, likely, \"Dance at Bougival,\" both from 1883.\"It wasnt just that she was good-looking,\" said Ireson. \"She understood how to perform, how to create a character. And so in different works, by different artists, she becomes almost a different person.\"A stop-start careerValadon did more than just pose. She used the sessions as informal training, observing and learning from the artists for whom she modeled. When she showed painter Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, he introduced her to Degas, who became her mentor in 1889.As she was beginning to stake her claim in the art world, Valadon was raising a young child. She had become pregnant at 18, and though she never named the father, Miguel Utrillo, a young artist with whom she had a close bond, formally claimed paternity.Valadons time as a model made her particularly intuitive in how to paint the body. Pictured: \"Reclining Nude,\" 1928. Credit: Sepia Times/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty ImagesWhen Valadon first began receiving attention for her work in her late 20s, Degas suggested she show at the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1894. \"For an untrained, lower-class woman artist to have her work accepted -- it was outlandish, unthinkable, impossible,\" Hewitt wrote.Valadon had five drawings of children accepted. In each, her subjects were depicted as moody and natural, unlike other domestic scenes of the time. But in the catalog, she was listed as the androgynous \"Valadon, S.\"Through her early exhibitions, Valadon caught the interest of major art dealers. But when she married businessman Paul Mousis and moved out of Paris, her artistic output slowed. Further complicating her life were her son Maurices troubles in school, and his growing alcohol addiction, which first took hold when he was a teenager. She often put her energy into Maurices artistic talent, hoping that a painting practice would ease his troubles.In Valadons first showing at the prestigious Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1894, for a series of drawings, her listed name, \"Valadon, S.,\" did not reveal her gender. Pictured: \"Woman in White Stockings,\" 1924. Credit: Suzanne ValadonThough Degas continued to submit Valadons work to exhibitions, she wouldnt give her full attention to her art career again until she was 45 years old, after she left her husband for the younger artist André Utter. She began to paint prolifically, making studies of herself and her family, as well as the nudes she became known for. In 1909, her painting \"Summer\" was accepted into the new and trendy Salon dAutomne, followed by her first solo show in 1911.In the 1920s, Valadon began receiving critical acclaim. She was mentioned on the front page of French newspaper Le Gaulois, and critics took notice of her 1921 show at John Levy Gallery in Paris. French critic André Warnod described her nudes as \"powerful,\" according to Hewitt, and observed that they \"enchant the viewer by virtue of the truth that emanates from them.\"Valadons figures didnt adhere to the delicate femininity that was expected of the time. They were contemporary women with modern clothes and hairstyles, as well as body hair -- a far cry from the timeless nudes so prevalent in art history, Ireson points out.Even more surprising were Valadons depictions of nude men, though she rarely painted them. \"The fact she was painting male nudes at all in the early 20th century was pretty shocking,\" Ireson said. \"And she paints the male nude in quite a sexualized way. You can see that theres a desire there; theres an appreciation of the body that was quite audacious for the time.\"Valadons sensual depictions of the male body were daring, like in 1914s \"Casting the Net.\" Credit: Suzanne ValadonIn 1923, in her late 50s, Valadon painted her most notable work, \"The Blue Room,\" depicting a curvy brunette reclining among the patterned blue sheets and curtains of a daybed, a stack of books at her feet. Caught mid-thought, a cigarette dangling from her mouth, she pays little attention to the viewer, emanating confidence through her casual ease.\"Strength, Suzanne suggested, was compatible with and even complementary to the idea of woman,\" wrote Hewitt of the work.Under-recognized after deathValadon also chronicled her own body as she aged, painting herself nude well into her 60s -- which, Ireson pointed out, would still \"raise a few eyebrows\" today. In her later self-portraits, she shows herself solemn, her mouth pursed, favoring hard edges and dark, neutral tones over the softer, brighter scenes of her earlier works.\"One of the things thats quite striking when you look at her self-portraits is her attitude to aging,\" said Ireson. \"(Theres) a refusal of prettiness there ... And an attention (to) the artifice of beautifying yourself, and then this very unflinching representation of her body as it changes.\"Valadon painted self-portraits as she aged, eschewing idealized views of herself. Pictured: \"Self-Portrait,\" 1927.In the last decade of her career, Valadon exhibited worldwide, with shows in New York, Prague, Chicago and Berlin. In 1938, after a lauded retrospective at Galerie Bernier in Paris, she died at the age of 72 after suffering a stroke. At the time, French art critic George Besson called her \"the most justifiably famous\" woman painter of the era, according to Hewitt, while another critic predicted that her \"place in the history of 20th-century painting is already assured.\"But history can be fickle, and Valadons fame dimmed following her death, perhaps because she was never associated with a particular art movement, or because she was overshadowed by her male peers. She was also routinely excluded from French art critic Louis Vauxcelles influential exhibitions and books, on the basis that he simply didnt like her work, according to Hewitt.But with figurative painting recently brought back to the fore, and overlooked women artists being revisited, Valadons work is primed for a revival.\"Its like an undiscovered chapter of a book that you figured you knew,\" Ireson said. \"If you know Toulouse-Lautrec and Renoir, and the painters of the 1920s and 30s, Suzanne Valadon is absolutely part of that story.\"Top caption: \"The Blue Room,\" from 1923, is Valadons best-known work.", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/suzanne-valadon-nudes-art-history/index.html"}, {"title": "The club kid designer dressing the most powerful women in US politics", "data_published": "2021-02-25T14:08:47Z", "content": "Written by Scarlett Conlon, CNNThere are times in every successful designers career when they find something they created at the center of a viral sensation. For Max Maras creative director, Ian Griffiths, discovering that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had ignited a global frenzy by wearing his red \"Fire Coat\" for her infamous showdown with Donald Trump in 2018 was one of those moments. It was not, however, quite as he had imagined it.\"It was 7 in the evening and I got the phone call from our American communications office. I had just got home from work and was in the middle of getting changed with my trousers around my knees,\" laughed Griffiths on the phone from his office in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy. \"They needed urgent confirmation the coat was ours, then more and more calls came in to give quotes.

With both Harris and Pelosi, he continued, \"it appeared they were not simply wearing (the coats) as a utility, but in a way that really made a statement (and) as a vehicle to say something I absolutely agree with.\" It was, he admitted, incredibly rewarding.Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a drive-in get out to vote rally in Philadelphia, 2020.

Unveiled digitally at Milan Fashion week Thursday, the Fall-Winter 2021 line is as empowering as one has come to expect from the Italian label.\"Celebrating this tremendous event, I was thinking about the Max Mara woman as a triumphant self-made queen in a moment of jubilation at her ascent,\" he enthused.The digital presentation kicked off with behind-the-scenes images of a model being enrobed in a Max Mara coat before taking to the circular runway inside the Triennale di Milano. The imposing curved space, which reminded Griffiths of Londons Regent Street, was decked out in flags featuring symbols from the brands archive to give the flavor of a coronation or parade. Among the symbols was a retro exclamation point that the designer discovered on 1950s Max Mara advertising from the brands archive.The symbol \"captures the entire spirit of the collection,\" he said. \"How (else) do you describe the sense of exhilaration and epic adventure of this 70-year ascent?\"Since its beginnings in 1951, Max Mara was obsessed with a love of all things \"authentically -- bordering on eccentrically -- British,\" Griffiths added. For this collection he looked to tractor-driving, helicopter-piloting, pioneering women by way of kilts (\"traditional but also rooted in punk culture\"); quilted coats made from pure camel hair; utilitarian jackets executed in sumptuous alpaca; organza shirts \"which are dramatically jaunty\"; and chunky socks and walking boots.According to the show notes, the collection is an \"urban country-mix\" with cocooning aran knits and slouchy tartan skirts.

Hills, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNNThe emancipation of slaves is central to the story of the American Civil War. But as curator and photographic historian Deborah Willis discovered growing up in the 1950s and 60s, the Black people who served in the conflict are often ignored by the history books.As she would later learn, almost 180,000 Black soldiers fought for the North in the name of ending slavery. By the end of the war, a tenth of the Union Army was made up of free African American men.\"When Black soldiers were fighting for their emancipation, they were fighting for not only their own (freedom), but that of their families and other Black people,\" Willis said in a video interview. \"They felt the cause was necessary to fight.\"By the end of the war in 1865, 40,000 Black Union soldiers had been killed, of whom three-quarters had died from infection or disease. Many of their individual stories have been lost, but Willis research uncovered moving tales of Black love, patriotism and bravery. Her recently published book , \"The Black Civil War Soldier: A Visual History of Conflict and Citizenship,\" shines a light on these forgotten soldiers and their families through a rich archive of rarely-seen photographs.A carte de visite of Lieutenant Peter Vogelsang, who served with the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. Credit: Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture\"Erasure appears in many ways,\" said Willis, who is a professor and department chair at New York Universitys Tisch School of the Arts.In the case of thousands of African American Civil War soldiers, she explained, their narratives werent \"hidden\" -- they were shared in diaries and letters. Many Black soldiers also paid to have photographic portraits taken that depicted them as patriotic free men. They can be seen dressed in military regalia, posing proudly with the American flag or holding the weapons they fought with.In her book, Willis presents almost 100 of the images, which date from the 1840s to 1860s, alongside family correspondence and news articles, offering an intimate account of the conflict. She also included the stories of Black medical workers, servants and cooks -- including those in the South, where thousands of enslaved African Americans were taken to war as laborers or forced to serve White soldiers.Willis book challenges readers to bear witness to their varied experiences.\"I wanted this book to be kind of a memory album of sorts -- the memory of the individuals who wrote articles in the newspapers or who wrote diaries and diary entries, but also (those) who shared the visual experience of photography,\" she said.African American hospital workers, including nurses, at a hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, July 1863. Credit: National ArchivesA new mediumEarly cameras first arrived in the United States in 1839, and by the time the Civil War began in 1861, commercial photography was taking off.Before leaving for war, some soldiers took portraits with loved ones as mementos in the event they didnt return. One picture in Willis book, set in a romantic brass frame, shows a husband and wife sitting beside each other. Another shows a saber-wielding soldier sitting beside his wife, who is dressed in a voluminous gown.Commercial photographers also set up temporary studios in tents near the army camps, creating what Willis called \"spaces for people to reimagine themselves.\" Soldiers would sometimes get photos taken to send home to their families, folding them up with love letters or notes sent home from the front lines.\"We dont talk about Black love in the 19th century,\" Willis said. \"We talk about survival which is, yes, a part of it. But having an opportunity to see a love story thats a mother and son, or a patriotic story of a man whos interested in his citizenship and freedom -- that kind of love is something I wanted to explore in this book.\"Portrait of an unidentified African American soldier in uniform, c. 1860s. Credit: Library of CongressWhile the Unions Black soldiers were fighting for the same cause as their White counterparts, their platoons remained segregated. So, too, were the wars makeshift photography studios. \"There were certain days that Black people could go into studios, and on Thursdays and Saturdays at midday, (they) would say, coloreds only,\" Willis said. \"And then other days were open to Whites.\"In the South, meanwhile, African Americans had hardly any opportunity to be photographed -- and not only because of their status in the Confederacy. Early camera equipment was not readily available in Southern states, Willis writes in her book, and the few photographers there raised their fees \"to compensate for the high prices of photographic materials and the inflated Confederate dollar.\"Significance of the momentThe uncovered photographs include ambrotypes, images made on chemically treated glass plates, and tintypes, a much faster innovation that imprinted pictures onto thin metal sheets dipped in a silver nitrate solution. Some of these photographs appear in elaborate protective cases lined with red velvet or brass frames engraved with American flags, eagles and stars.An early form of paper photograph known as a \"carte de visite,\" which was often used as a formal calling card, was also increasingly popular in the Civil War era. Examples in Willis book include portraits of famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who served in the Union Army and rescued enslaved people through a secretive network called the Underground Railroad; Nicholas Biddle, a Black man believed to be the first person wounded in the conflict after a racist mob hurled a brick at him; and Thomas Morris Chester, the first African American war correspondent for a major daily newspaper.A portrait of Harriet Tubman, who rescued enslaved people during the American Civil War. Credit: Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and CulturePhotographers typically charged between 25 cents and $2.50 ($6 to $60 in todays money), depending on the size of the image, according to Willis research. There were additional fees for hand-painted details, such as an American flag.Given that Black Northern soldiers were paid less than their White counterparts -- just $10 per month, with a further $3 deducted for uniforms, compared to the $13 and free clothing enjoyed by White soldiers -- having a photograph taken was relatively expensive. It was thus a \"self-conscious act,\" Willis wrote, adding that it \"shows the subjects were aware of the significance of the moment and sought to preserve it.\"For Willis, however, the pictures and stories are as much to do with the present as the past. The historian hopes to help younger generations visualize \"a broader story\" about Black peoples role in the Civil War, sharing experiences of Black American history that go beyond the narratives of slavery.\"The absence of those stories dehumanizes young people,\" she said, adding: \"How can they reflect on the past without creating a future for themselves if its only about a struggle?\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/black-civil-war-soldiers-photos/index.html"}, {"title": "Censored letters between Marie-Antoinette and her rumored lover revealed in full with X-rays", "data_published": "2021-10-04T16:21:09Z", "content": "Written by Jack Guy, CNNRedacted lines from letters between Marie-Antoinette and her alleged lover have been revealed for the first time, using advanced scientific techniques.The letters, exchanged by the doomed French queen and Count Axel von Fersen of Sweden during the French Revolution , were analyzed by a team of scientists from the Centre de Recherche sur la Conservation (CRC) in France, who published their findings in the journal Science Advances on Friday.The Bruker M6 Jetstream XRF scanner during the analysis of the letter of September 26, 1791 written by Queen Marie-Antoinette to von Fersen Credit: Centre de Recherche sur la Conservation\"Whether state secrets, escape plans, or evidence of a royal love affair, this presumably sensitive content has been puzzling historians for almost 150 years,\" reads the study, which also details how von Fersen helped organize a failed attempt to smuggle the royal family out of France.Some of the letters between the pair, sent from June 1791 to August 1792, are held in the French national archives.Certain words in the letters had been written over with random letters designed to obscure them.The team analyzed sections of 15 different letters, and found consistent differences in the copper-to-iron and zinc-to-iron ratios of inks in eight of them.The scientists used x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, which is used to determine the elemental composition of materials, and data processing techniques to reveal the hidden words, such as \"beloved,\" \"tender friend,\" \"adore,\" and \"madly.\"The scanner during the analysis of a letter written on October 25, 1791 by von Fersen to Marie-Antoinette Credit: Centre de Recherche sur la ConservationAnalysis showed that some of the letters thought to have been written by Marie-Antoinette were in fact copies of originals sent by von Fersen. This was common practice at the time, when \"copies of important letters could be made for political or administrative reasons,\" according to the study.In addition, all of von Fersens letters had similar ratios of ink elements, which matched with some of the ink used to redact words.This points to the possibility that von Fersen was responsible for censoring the letters between himself and the wife of King Louis XVI, \"suggesting that they were important to him either for sentimental or political reasons,\" CRC said in a press release.The researchers hope their techniques can be used to unveil more redacted historical content.Marie-Antoinette is famed as the last queen of France before the revolution.In March 1791, her jewelry was wrapped and placed in a wooden chest and smuggled out of France to Vienna by a loyal retainer for safekeeping.Both Marie-Antoinette, an Austrian archduchess by birth, and her husband, Louis XVI, were executed by guillotine in October 1793.

And while poverty is evident in pictures of barefoot villagers crowding around for a photo, or of Dublins working-class tenement buildings, there are also well-to-do family shots and depictions of upper-class pastimes like fox hunting.\"There were many different social classes in Ireland, as in many countries, so I think its important to show the full range,\" said Breslin in a phone interview from Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. \"We have a mixture of the wealthier classes and the gentry, and then youve got people who are just trying to survive and gather water and turf (peat) to burn on their fires.\"The project, \"Old Ireland in Colour,\" now has dedicated social media accounts with tens of thousands of followers.

After discovering an AI-powered colorization tool, DeOldify, he started applying the technique to photos from archives and libraries across Ireland.Using a process known as deep learning, AI software can be taught how to colorize. The \"training\" involves analyzing thousands of normal color photos, as well as black and white versions of the same images, to help it understand which colors correlate to different shapes and textures, explained Breslin, who specializes in engineering and computer science.Then, when the software encounters an image that only exists in black and white, it knows \"what the colors should probably be,\" he said. \"So, for example, the grass or trees or the sea -- it knows from those textures and shapes that they should be green or blue.\"Revolutionary statesman Éamon de Valera addresses a crowd in 1917.

There were certain idiosyncrasies to life in Ireland that the US-developed software was not trained to recognize.\"An average kind of color (of a roof), around the world, might be a terracotta, an orange or a kind of a brownish-type tile,\" Breslin said. \"Whereas in Ireland, the roofs were typically slate, which is gray or black.\"This is where his collaborator, Buckley, who specializes in Irish social history, came in. The pair researched everything from clothing and pigments available in Ireland at the time, to the uniforms worn by various military units, before manually changing colors and shades based on what they found.The project also features photos of Irish people overseas, such as this 1911 image from an expedition to Antarctica.

Some historians believe software like DeOldify can produce misleading results that obfuscate, rather than enhance, the content of old photographs.But the practice is \"nothing new,\" Breslin said, adding that people have been colorizing photos \"since the advent of photography,\" albeit without the help of AI or other software like Photoshop. He also argued that his images exist in addition to, not instead of, the originals.The eviction of farmers by their landlords -- as depicted in this scene, from the village of Woodford -- was the source of huge controversy in 1880s Ireland.

If the success of their book so far is anything to go by (though not released in North America until next month, it was among Irelands best-selling titles in 2020), he may well be right.\"Were being bombarded with so much information, knowledge, bite-sized media and content, so, for the younger generation particularly, it can be hard for history to compete,\" Breslin said. \"Its important to be able to relate more to our history, and colorization definitely makes things more relatable.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/old-ireland-color-photos-breslin/index.html"}, {"title": "The Pantheon: The ancient building still being used after 2,000 years", "data_published": "2020-11-16T11:18:09Z", "content": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN Contributors Video: Ed Scott-Clarke, Tem Doran, Alex Sears, Angelica Pursley, CNNWhen visitors walk into the Pantheon in Rome and encounter its colossal dome, they may experience the same theatricality as its guests nearly 2,000 years ago.\"Anyone who steps inside the Pantheon immediately feels the crushing weight of human history, but also the incredible lightness of human creativity,\" said John Ochsendorf, professor of architecture at MIT and former director of the American Academy in Rome.Ancient Roman architects designed a portico for the Pantheon that referenced Greek architecture.

Credit: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesBuilt around 125 A.D. by the Roman emperor Publius Aelius Hadrianus, it was actually the third iteration of the structure. The first Pantheon caught fire around 80 A.D. and was rebuilt shortly after, but it was struck by lightning and burned down again around 110 A.D. The buildings ill fate led to rumors that the Pantheon was cursed.The facade of the completed structure riffed on ancient Greek motifs, with a portico entrance featuring a pediment -- a triangular top -- and two rows of Corinthian columns. The interior was sweeping and airy, capped by a dome that to this day -- is still the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world.What was it used for?Pantheon means \"all gods,\" and though its commonly thought the structure was a site of worship dedicated to Roman deities, its original purpose is actually unknown.With scant mentions of it in Ancient texts, historians have been left somewhat in the dark. Though it could be a temple, Roman buildings were typically multi-purpose structures, said Lynne Lancaster, an architectural historian and humanities educator. \"And so what actually went on in the Pantheon is hard to say.\"The Pantheon may have been used for a variety of purposes, but historians arent quite sure what took place inside. Credit: Pino Pacifico/REDA&CO/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesLegends say its the very site where Romes founder, Romulus, ascended to heaven. Others believe the Pantheon was where the Roman emperor could communicate with the gods. Whatever the case, like many Roman architectural feats, the imposing structure was a show of might, an \"important symbol of imperial power,\" said Luca Mercuri, the Pantheons current director.Indeed, Roman architecture of the time embodied wealth, strength and dignity. Centuries later, Neoclassical architects would reference the Pantheons portico and dome combination to imbue their buildings with those same values, from the US Capitol in Washington, DC., to the Somerset House in London.How was it built?The Pantheon was an architectural marvel of the Roman Empire.The oculus -- Latin for \"eye\" -- stretches 30 feet across, opening the structure to the heavens. The sun beams through the oculus, and when it storms, the rain comes down like a waterfall into the interior.The Pantheons dome and oculus were a feat of engineering -- Medieval religious leaders believed the architectural achievement was evil. Credit: Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images\"The oculus at the center seemed to tempt fate and leave (the Pantheon) open to the sky,\" said Ochsendorf. \"But it also showed a mastery of geometry and construction -- that they could build domes on that scale and leave an oculus open at the center, in a way (that was) almost showing off.\"During the Middle Ages, religious leaders, who were incredulous of the feat, cast doubt on the holiness of the Pantheon, believing it to be the work of the devil.But it wasnt Satan; it was engineering.Though white, yellow, purple and black marble was imported from around the Mediterranean, it was concrete -- a Roman invention -- that allowed architects to do away with load-bearing columns and introduce spacious domes.Along with the entry door, the oculus is the only natural source of light in the building. Credit: Alessandra Tarantino/APOne trick to make a large dome stable was to use progressively lighter stone in the concrete mix as it reached the top. Heavy brick could be used at the base, with spongy, light volcanic rock around the oculus.Though the Pantheon has revealed some of its design secrets, Lancaster said she still finds magic in the details.

To do so, he wrote a simple game based on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help assess how powerful the computer was -- and provide a bit of fun.Little did he know that the resulting game would go on to become one of the greatest, most addictive and most successful of all time.It was June 6, 1984, and Tetris had just started its journey from behind the Iron Curtain.The original version of Tetris.Tetris is a puzzle game in which geometric shapes called \"tetrominoes\" fall down onto a playing field, and the player has to arrange them to form gapless lines. Pajitnov took inspiration from pentomino, a classic puzzle game consisting of all the different shapes that can be made by combining five squares -- 12 in total -- with the goal of arranging them in a wooden box like a jigsaw puzzle.To simplify things, he knocked that down to four squares, thus reducing the number of shapes from 12 to seven. He called the game Tetris, combining the Greek numeral \"tetra\" (meaning four) and tennis, his favorite sport.Pajitnov himself was immediately hooked. \"I couldnt stop myself from playing this prototype version, because it was very addictive to put the shapes together,\" he said on the phone from Seattle, where he now lives.Tetris was inspired by pentomino, a classic board game. Credit: ShutterstockBut creating a video game in Soviet Russia at the height of the Cold War was far from easy. It was only through the sheer brilliance of its design that Tetris was transformed from a quirky test program into a worldwide phenomenon.Word of mouthAlthough Tetris became immediately popular among programmers with access to an Electronika 60, the machine had no graphical capabilities -- and less memory than todays calculators. Pressed with requests to create a version of the game for the IBM PC, a more widespread computer with better graphics, Pajitnov assigned the job to Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old student on a summer job at his office (today an engineer at Google). The game spread quickly. \"It was like a wood fire. Everyone in the Soviet Union who had a PC had Tetris on it,\" said Pajitnov.Pajitnov wasnt making any money off the game, nor did he intend to. Ideas were owned by the state and the very concept of selling software as a product was unfamiliar to him. People were just sharing Tetris through word of mouth and by copying it onto floppy disks.Then, Pajitnov heard rumors that the game might have crossed borders and was being played in other Eastern bloc countries. In 1986, he got a message via telex -- a forerunner of the fax machine -- from Robert Stein, a salesman for a Hungary-based software company called Andromeda. Stein, who had seen Tetris in Hungary, wanted to secure the rights to sell it as a computer game in the West. He offered significant money in advance.\"My English was really bad at that time, so I put together some kind of positive answer, saying we were very glad to receive the proposal and that some agreement could be made,\" said Pajitnov. He knew that doing business directly with a Western firm could have landed him in jail, even before making any money, so he started investigating how he could sell the rights to Tetris through the state.Stein, however, interpreted his response as a green light and immediately started producing the game. But as he was preparing to launch, he received another telex from Elorg -- short for Electronorgtechnica, the Soviet organization that oversaw software and hardware exports. It said that the rights had not been officially granted and that his launch was illegal.Eventually, Stein cleared the rights, and Tetris was released as a commercial PC title in the UK and the US in 1988. The game played up its Soviet origins through Kremlin-themed illustrations and Cyrillic characters. But the misunderstanding between Pajitnov and Stein showed how tricky it would be to export a video game from Soviet Russia to the West for the first time -- an issue that led to years of confusion and legal battles, and is even rumored to have landed on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.Pajitnov and his son with the UK and US PC versions of Tetris in 1989. Credit: Wojtek Laski/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe Game BoyTetris was selling well on computers, but the big money in the games sector was being made elsewhere: consoles. Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game developer and businessman living in Japan, was the first to realize that Tetris was a perfect match for the Game Boy, a new handheld system released by Nintendo in Japan in early 1989. The console was about to launch in North America and Europe too, and Rogers set out to convince the company to bundle a copy of the game in the box, a common practice outside of Japan.\"I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,\" said Rogers in a phone interview. \"He said, Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario. And I said, If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.\"Rogers set out to obtain the necessary permissions, and soon realized what a challenge that would be. He had already published a version of Tetris in Japan, for the popular Nintendo Famicom home system, only to discover that there were half a dozen companies all claiming to own the rights to the game. \"So I got on a plane and went to Moscow on a tourist visa to track down the source of the rights, Elorg -- and talk my way into it,\" he said.Once in Moscow, Rogers made little progress until he hired an interpreter, who swiftly took him to Elorg.\"She knew immediately where everything was, so that was fishy. Theyre not supposed to talk to foreigners, and I wasnt supposed to talk to the Russians, let alone people inside the government. So I broke all kinds of rules by being there. They interrogated me for two hours. I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,\" he said.But among the officials in the room was Alexey Pajitnov, who immediately took a liking to Rogers. \"Alexey was the only guy in the room who actually knew anything about games,\" Rogers recalled. \"I explained how business worked, and we became friends. A week later, I left Moscow with a signed agreement for Tetris on the Game Boy.\"Henk Rogers and Alexey Pajitnov in Moscows Red Square.The Game Boy version of Tetris sold 35 million units and helped the console become one of the most successful of all time. It is still considered by many -- Pajitnov included -- to be the best version of Tetris, and it created an unprecedented synergy between hardware and software, epitomizing the gaming mantra \"easy to learn, hard to master.\"Delayed royaltiesDespite the games success, Pajitnov was still not making any money from it. \"There was a lot of legal trouble, and when the question of ownership and the original source of the game came up, I decided that I wanted everything to go smoothly and I granted the rights to the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for 10 years,\" he said.The legal trouble culminated in a skirmish between Nintendo and Atari over the home console rights for Tetris. A judge ruled in Nintendos favor in late 1989, dealing a lethal blow to Atari, which had already produced hundreds of thousands of now useless copies of its version of the game, under the tagline \"Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game.\" Nintendo took a different approach, opting for the slogan \"From Russia with fun.\"Pajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991, with the help of his friend Henk Rogers. And when his deal over the rights expired in 1995, he finally started receiving royalties for the game. \"And theyve been fine so far,\" he said.Pajitnov and Rogers in 2018.In 1996, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company, to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. In 2005, the Tetris Company bought Elorg -- which after the fall of the Soviet Union had transformed from a state-owned company into a private one -- gaining total control of all Tetris rights worldwide. The company has even standardized and trademarked the names and colors of every Tetris piece -- officially called Tetriminos , rather than the generic tetrominoes, although they have many unofficial nicknamesTetris has been the subject of several scientific studies. One found that playing the game can be effective in fighting off cravings for food and even drugs, while another noted an increase in the thickness of some parts of the brain in people who had played regularly. Playing Tetris for prolonged periods of time can lead to players dreaming to about the falling pieces or interpreting real-world objects as tetrominoes and mentally re-arranging them -- a phenomenon known as \"the Tetris Effect.\"To date, Tetris has been released on over 65 platforms, a world record , with more than half a billion downloads on mobile devices, according to the Tetris Company. Pajitnov has personally worked on over 100 variants of the game.The latest, released in early 2019 to coincide with the games 35th anniversary, is an online multiplayer version called \"Tetris 99,\" which can be played by up to 99 players simultaneously. Since 2010, an eSports tournament based on the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris has seen the worlds best players gather in Portland, Oregon. Some of the matches, which can surpass 30 minutes in length, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.\"It hasnt lost any of its play value and nothing has come to replace Tetris,\" said Henk Rogers, explaining the games enduring popularity.\"Its like Happy Birthday. There have been lots of songs that come and go, but Happy Birthday is it still always sung in the same way.

They memorialized their feelings with these photographs, and then had to hide them forever,\" he said.Forbidden loveThe photos show young couples that could have only dreamed of the freedoms afforded to Nini and Treadwell, who wed unofficially in 1992 (and then legally 14 years later, after Massachusetts became the first US state to permit same-sex marriage).Nonetheless, their collection shows historical examples of men exchanging rings and partaking in informal wedding ceremonies. In one image, believed to be from the turn of the 20th century, a young pair are seen holding a sign reading, \"Not married but willing to be.\"As well as showing the evolution of attitudes, hairstyles and fashion through the decades, the images also chart the development of photography as a medium. The collections oldest pictures were made using early forms of camera, and include ambrotypes, which were produced on glass, and daguerreotypes, which appeared on metal plates.As well as posed portraits, the collection contains pictures of couples lying in bed and having picnics.

Was it shared by friends? Was it celebrated by a family? How did it make its way into our hands?\"An undated image believed to have been taken in the US.

Or its an elderly gay person, or straight people -- the whole gamut,\" Treadwell said.\"The message of our book is not about sexuality at all,\" Nini added. \"Our position is that love doesnt have a sexuality -- its universal.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/loving-photographs-nini-treadwell/index.html"}, {"title": "'He died in my arms.' Twelve months on, a mother's agonizing wait to find out why her son died at Lekki toll gate", "data_published": "2021-10-19T04:25:39Z", "content": "The full names of some interviewees and the identities of others have been withheld for their safety.Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) When Adesola heard about the shooting at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos on October 20, 2020, she immediately thought of her son who had earlier left home to join the hundreds of young people protesting against police brutality at the site.In a blind panic, she called his phone, but there was no answer. She immediately hailed a passing motorcycle taxi, known locally as an Okada, and raced to the scene.But nothing could have prepared her for the harrowing scenes she witnessed when she got there, she said.\"While I was looking for my son... I saw people running and someone was in the gutter and had an iron bar in his eye. The person was already dead,\" she recalled.\"Adesola\" where her son is buried, pictured in Lagos on Oct. 16, 2021. Her son was one of the protesters killed at Lekki toll gate last year.We have also withheld her sons name at her request.\"We got there around 5 or 6 am,\" she said in her first sit-down interview. \"We saw a lot of people. There was a child holding a Nigerian flag lying dead, there was a bullet wound on the side of his body.\"He was a small boy and there were a lot of people there,\" she told CNN from a makeshift wooden structure where she ekes out a living selling cold beverages.He died in my armsAs Adesola surveyed the scenes of chaos and stepped over the hastily discarded belongings of panicked protesters, she spotted a familiar figure lying in a pool of blood on the ground, wearing just one shoe.\"When I saw my son, I shouted and held him... The blood was too much, there was a bullet wound on his chest. His clothes were torn and the bullet had come out of his back,\" she said, weeping as she recounted the painful moment.Despite his injuries, she discovered her son was still alive.\"I saw other people carrying their relatives, so I tried to carry him because he was still breathing at that moment. I called for help and people came to help me put him in a vehicle,\" she said.\"He was looking at us while we were carrying him. He was just screaming ah, ah, in pain.\"They tried desperately to revive him in the car, but he didnt make it, she told CNN.\"He died in my arms,\" Adesola said. \"I was shouting and I couldnt keep calm.\"Her son was buried almost immediately in line with Muslim burial rites.He was 32 and left behind two children, 14 and nine, who had also lost their mother in undisclosed circumstances a few years earlier.No official death tollAdesola says she is thankful she was able to find her sons body. Others were not so fortunate.CNN spoke to several families during an investigation last year who were yet to locate the bodies of their missing loved ones -- protesters at the toll gate -- who dozens of eyewitnesses say were shot at, first by members of the Nigerian army and then hours later by police.Wisdom Okons relatives told CNN last year he went missing after he went to the toll gate. He is still missing.Witnesses told CNN that ambulances were stopped from entering by Nigerian authorities.There is no official death toll, but an Amnesty International investigation found that at least 12 people died at Lekki toll gate and another site on October 20.Eyewitnesses told CNN they saw the army remove a number of bodies from the scene.The CNN investigation pieced together what happened when the Nigerian army and later the police opened fire on civilians as they protested police brutality.It used time stamps, video data, and geolocation to analyze hours of video shot by protesters -- tracking the armys movements to the Lekki toll gate where protests had been taking place for almost two weeks.Video shot by an eyewitness appears to show the army shooting toward the crowd. The Nigerian government threatened to sanction CNN for its report.The Nigerian Armys account of what happened has shifted over time.In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the army denied any involvement, describing reports of the incident as \"fake news,\" before backtracking and saying that soldiers were present but fired their weapons in the air and used blanks.It said that hoodlums were mixed into the crowds of protesters.On November 14, during a judicial inquiry into the shooting, army representative Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo (who has since been promoted to the rank of major general) admitted that the soldiers at the scene had live rounds but continued to deny that anyone was shot.\"Theres no way officers and men will kill their brothers and sisters. I repeat no way. We have those who constantly seek to drive a wedge between us and between the citizens of Nigeria...,\" he said at the time.JUST WATCHED Government CCTV footage helps corroborate CNN Nigeria investigation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Government CCTV footage helps corroborate CNN Nigeria investigation 03:54Protesters and witnesses posted several videos in which bullet casings were displayed which they say were recovered from the scene.At the time of the incident, police denied shooting anyone.CNN has made renewed attempts to obtain comments for this latest report from the Nigerian armed forces, police, and the federal government, but has received no response.A protest movement silencedAngry young Nigerians took to the streets, blocking major roads across cities in Africas most populous nation, in largely peaceful protests. They marched in tens of thousands chanting \"Enough is Enough\" against police brutality and violence.Their initial demands were for a notorious police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, or SARS, to be shut down, but the marches morphed into protests campaigning for police reform and an end to bad governance in the oil-rich country.During the protests, participants erected tents and DJ booths at various sites across the country and held multi-faith prayer sessions as well as a \"festival of lights,\" to honor the victims of police brutality, held at the now-infamous Lekki toll gate.A Nigerian youth seen waving the Nigerian national flag during the protests.Adesola questions why the protesters were dispersed with such brutal force that night.\"Even if the government wanted to chase them from the place, they were not supposed to shoot. They could have asked them to stop and not shoot. Everyone could have found their way.\"Adesola says her son took part in the protests as \"a concerned Nigerian,\" and in what would be their final phone call, he described a scene of calm where people were protesting peacefully and had come prepared to camp overnight.\"All his mates had been going there and when he came back from work on that day, he said he was going to join his friends. When he got there, he called me and said a lot of people were there. Some were sleeping there with their mattress and had brought their cooking gas. If the soldiers did not come, things would have gone well without any problems,\" she said.No accountabilityOne year on from the Lekki toll gate shootings, and no one has taken responsibility for what happened that night, nor has anyone been held to account.In a short report released Tuesday, titled \"Nigeria: A Year On, No Justice for #EndSARS Crackdown,\" Human Rights Watch said: \"The prospects for accountability remain inconclusive and bleak. Nigerian authorities should take concrete and decisive steps to ensure that those implicated in abuses against protesters are held accountable.\"The judicial hearing set up in October 2020 by the Lagos state government to look into cases of police brutality -- and the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad -- and to investigate the tollgate incident has been beset with delays and other issues.\"Nigerias authorities should take effective steps toward accountability to show victims that their loss, pain, and suffering is not in vain,\" said Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch.The Lagos State panel set up to investigate the shooting and other cases of abuse visits Lekki toll gate on Oct. 30, 2020.\"Anything less will worsen distrust of the government and reinforce the perception that the lives of citizens do not matter.\"Many Nigerians believe the issues that drew the protests 12 months ago still persist -- and those who were there that fateful night are still seeking justice.DJ Switch, a local musician whose real name is Obianuju Catherine Udeh, was at the protest and live-streamed much of the evening on her Instagram page.A year later she recalls how she thought they were all going to die. \"I thought it was the end for all of us there. You know, I mean when you sing the national anthem and wave your flag, your Nigerian flag, and the shooting doesnt stop, you only have one thought left in your mind,\" she said.Soon after the shootings, DJ Switch says she had to flee Nigeria , afraid for her safety, and she hasnt been back since.\"Justice is there waiting to be done, whos going to do it? Young people are asking every day for accountability, whos willing to be responsible -- to take responsibility,\" she said.Now Adesola is picking up the pieces after her eldest sons death.Asked what she would say if she could talk directly to the Nigerian government, she said: \"I will say to them the same thing I am saying to you.\"I cannot be lying about my childs death. I will show them his grave.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/10/19/africa/lekki-toll-gate-shooting-one-year-intl-cmd/index.html"}, {"title": "Three children killed in airstrikes on Ethiopia's Tigray region, UN says", "data_published": "2021-10-19T15:39:35Z", "content": "(CNN) Three children were killed and one person was injured in Mondays airstrikes in Mekelle, the capital of Ethiopias war-torn Tigray region, the United Nations said Tuesday.Jens Laerke, spokesperson of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said at a briefing in Geneva that local health workers in the Mekelle hospital confirmed that the children had been killed as a result of an airstrike on the outskirts of the city.A second airstrike in Mekelle town \"reportedly injured nine people and caused damage to houses and a nearby hotel,\" Laerke said, adding that the \"intensification of the conflict is very alarming.\"A spokesman for the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) accused Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Monday of targeting civilians in an attack on a busy market day.

It was the last time that airstrikes were launched on Mekelle.The operation was initiated after Abiy accused the TPLF of attacking a federal military base in Mekelle, and after Tigrays leaders took the decision to elect a regional administration.In July, Tigrayan fighters retook Mekelle -- a city of a half-million people -- marking a stunning turn in the countrys devastating conflict.In the wake of Mekelles capture, the Ethiopian government announced a unilateral ceasefire for several months.

More than $85 billion has been invested by the US government in tackling HIV/AIDS around the worldNkengasong would potentially fill the leadership vacuum at PEPFAR, which has been without a leader for nearly two years.Steve Ahuka, an incident manager for the Democratic Republic of Congos Covid-19 response, told CNN that he hopes Nkengasong and Ihekweazus successors will be as passionate as their predecessors in the fight against infectious diseases.\"Though we will prefer to have them [Nkengasong and Ihekweazu] during this moment when the African continent is facing Covid-19 crisis, the battle against infectious diseases is done as a team... I hope Nkengasong and Ihekweazu have built a strong team in Nigeria and the Africa CDC, and their successors will continue the work to fight the Covid crisis,\" Ahuka said.Dr. Githinji Gitahi, a member of the Africa CDCs governing board, told CNN that Nkengasong \"will be difficult to replace.\"\"Nkengasong has built a formidable reputation for the Africa CDC and attracted partners and resources that have enabled it to achieve its mandate of coordination of disease surveillance and response. He will be greatly missed,\" he said.Gitahi wants regional centers of the Africa CDC to be strengthened so that the power of the parent organization is devolved.However, he said it was important that Nkengasong and Ihekweazu were moving to institutions \"that have a huge impact on the health of African people and their health security.\"A spokesman for Ugandas health ministry, Ainebyoona Emmanuel, told CNN Nkengasong and Ihekweazus exit from the continent \"is not a brain drain, but rather African leaders advancing to global leaders.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/10/16/africa/africa-health-experts-brain-drain-intl-cmd/index.html"}, {"title": "Covid-19 vaccine boosters are 'immoral' and 'unfair', says WHO chief", "data_published": "2021-10-12T20:31:45Z", "content": "(CNN) Distributing Covid-19 vaccine booster shots in some countries while inoculations across Africa lag is \"immoral,\" according to the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO).The increasing use of boosters is \"immoral, unfair and unjust and it has to stop,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told CNNs Becky Anderson on Tuesday.\"To start boosters is really the worst we can do as a global community.

She works on behalf of teenagers through her activism on teenage pregnancy.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion articles on CNN.(CNN) When Uganda ran out of vaccines shortly after the first doses arrived in March, it was another blow for girls and young women who have made extraordinary sacrifices as our country struggles to keep Covid-19 at bay.Schools and universities were again shuttered, leaving 15 million students at home or on the streets. Workers went unpaid and fear spread through the communities. The impacts were felt first and hardest by women, especially if they were young.Months later, the lockdown has not been fully lifted. People wait for hours in the street for the few vaccines that have crossed our borders. With less than 1% of the population fully vaccinated, we are vulnerable to more infectious and deadly variants such as Delta. But yet countries in Europe and North America hoard so many vaccines they are unable to use them all. I wonder whether their citizens know how were suffering? Perhaps our fate seems distant to them. So let me tell you what vaccine inequity means if youre a young woman in Uganda.During the pandemic, a lockdown generation lost opportunities to learn and has little hope of catching up. Only a privileged few were able to afford to learn online. The rest will bear the costs of the education emergency for the rest of their lives.But this is not just about our right to learn. Girls and young women find safety in their schools and colleges. Education empowers them to speak up for their rights. It brings them respect in their families and communities. As education closures have forced young women home or onto the streets, predators have spotted an opportunity. A shadow pandemic of sexual abuse has spread , with an over 20% increase in pregnancies among teenage girls, according to the United Nations Childrens Fund. Women have been forced into marriages or to exchange sex for money to survive.been I have spent the lockdown campaigning against teenage pregnancy. I have also set up a program to get women the menstrual health products that have denied to them during the pandemic. Shops have been closed or have not had deliveries. Families have stopped buying their girls sanitary products because they cannot afford them and also because they think they do not need them if they are not in school. I have met vulnerable young women who have sold sex so they can buy a sanitary pad.Young Ugandans are resourceful; young women above all. I am a 22-year-old law student, and I used to sell cakes from my bakery, although that has been forced out of business by the pandemic. I also work in a grassroots justice center where we help people fight back when they are evicted from their houses or land, or when they suffer other injustices the powerful perpetuate on those who cannot afford to defend themselves.During the pandemic, we have given young women sanitary products, but we also helped them learn how to make reusable pads which they sell to others as well. These efforts demonstrate how we have helped each other at a time when the world has largely looked away. But self help is not enough. Ugandas story is typical of other African countries, the continent where the worlds young people are increasingly concentrated . More than 40% of the people yet to be born this century are projected to be young AfricansYoung women across Africa demand vaccine equity. I am one of the young people that UN Secretary-General António Guterres asked to advise him on Our Common Agenda , a plan for how the world can recover from Covid-19. Guterres has warned the world faces breakdown, with societies hit by the next crisis well before this pandemic has been vanquished. His new agenda calls for a global vaccination plan to get doses into the arms of people who need it most. As the worlds leaders gather at the UN in New York this week, we are presenting them with our report and watching to see whether they will set up an emergency task force to respond to this call.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinions new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and FacebookThe global vaccination plan is just the start of meeting young peoples demands. Throughout 2021, we have worked with young leaders, thinkers, and activists from across the world to build an agenda for the future that makes the young the top priority for global cooperation.We presented the Secretary-General with our proposals for a new deal for a new generation to rebuild our education systems, find us decent jobs, and stop the planetary emergency from stealing our futures. He included many of our recommendations in Our Common Agenda such as a contract for the future to protect the needs of future generations that would set out the worlds obligations to people born in this century. We urge governments to use the United Nations as a platform for their immediate implementation.In Kampala, I will continue to help young women tackle the violence that threatens them. I will also keep working for justice in local communities. But the pandemic has taught me how much our fates are dependent on decisions made by powerful people in faraway places. And that is why I will mobilize with the worlds other young women activists in the hope that, if we speak as one, we will finally be heard.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/20/opinions/covid-19-vaccines-and-women-in-uganda-amoding/index.html"}, {"title": "South Africa mulls vaccine passports as Covid-19 restrictions are eased", "data_published": "2021-09-13T13:07:09Z", "content": "(CNN) South Africa will start to ease several Covid-19 restrictions as infection rates decrease in the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday.Amongst other measures, the nationwide curfew will be reduced to 11pm until 4am, the size of gatherings can increase to 250 people indoors and 500 outdoors, and restrictions on alcohol sales will be further reduced.

The hospital, which is now exclusively treating Covid-19 patients, is struggling to cope under the strain of Kenyas Delta variant-fueled fourth wave.The official nationwide data, which shows an average of just 20 deaths per day over the past week, tells only a small fraction of the full story -- everyone here, it seems, knows someone who has died from the virus.The Mount Kenya Hospital, like many others across the country, is turning away new patients because it simply doesnt have enough room. It is also lacking resources.Despite a newly installed oxygen compressor, extra cylinders, trucked in every day, are still needed to meet demand.Four patients arrive, desperately in need of a bed in an intensive care unit, but there are none.Without an ICU bed, their chances of survival are not good.Fear of the vaccineMost of the patients at Mount Kenya are unvaccinated -- not because they didnt have access to a vaccine, but because, in most cases, they chose not to take it.\"When you ask why they didnt get the jab, some of them, theyre told its not available. Others -- the majority -- they fear to have it, because theyve heard of the issues,\" explains Eudiah Wangombe, the hospital clinician who runs the facility.People have also heard stories of vaccinated people falling ill or even dying after receiving the vaccine.\"Thats not true, I am on the ground. Those people who have died so far, have not received anything... Theres a lot of misinformation,\" says Wangombe.Kenya has struggled with vaccine supply since day one, so far only 3.6 million doses of vaccine have arrived in Kenya, the latest shipment coming from the UK just this week.Even with every available dose, it would only be enough to inoculate roughly 3.5% of the population. But even as supply issues slowly ease, vaccine hesitancy is quickly emerging as a very serious problem.Along a busy street in Nyeri town, everyone is masked -- its the law in Kenya -- and street vendors sell masks and hand sanitizer along with their usual assortment of clothes and household knickknacks.Selling the vaccine, though, is a more difficult task and misinformation is rife.The early stigma surrounding the virus, denial, general misinformation, and some traditional beliefs are all contributing to an unhealthy skepticism of the health system and vaccines. Misinformation, spread mostly by word of mouth has been a challenge for the government to overcome, as health officials plead with citizens to take the vaccine in regular Covid-19 TV briefings.Jane Wangari Kahemu, a mask vendor in Nyeri\"We heard that Kenya was making Covid-19 vaccines, thats why we are scared. They dont even know how to make matchboxes or even toothpicks,\" says Jane Wangari Kahemu, a mask-vendor.The Kenyan government does have a long-term plan to produce its own vaccines, but its still a long way off.Kahemu would take the vaccine, if she knew for sure it was American, she says.\"Why should I take something that I dont know what it will do to my body?\" another vendor asks, holding his baby son in his arms.His colleague agrees. \"If, and I say IF with capital letters, if we understand about it, maybe we can do it, but for now its a no!\"A boon for coffin-makersAlong a dusty road, a stones throw from the local morgue, a small black hearse is parked opposite a strip of coffin vendors. Lately, it has been a hive of activity.Outside, a group of young men cut, sand, plaster and paint an array of caskets in different shapes and sizes as quickly as they can.Before the pandemic, they were making fewer than one coffin a day.Coffin builders in NyeriNow each man is expected to make three a day and they cant keep up with demand, forcing the owner to recruit more coffin makers.Before the pandemic, they were making less than one coffin a day — sometimes only one per week. Now each man is expected to make three coffins a day — and the owner has hired twice his normal staff to keep up with the demand.\"The workload is too hard for us now,\" said 34-year-old coffin builder Joseph Mureithi. \"We are working on very tight schedule and we can even say we are suffering fatigue right now.\"He says that many people who are hesitant simply dont know enough about it, but he thinks more and more people are starting to seek out the vaccine because so many people are dying from the virus.\"Unless you see the impact of something, you wont take it seriously,\" he says standing over an unfinished casket he had just began to plaster.Yet many of the Mureithis colleagues still say they wouldnt take the vaccine if it was offered to them.Dennis Maina, a slight 24-year-old in jeans and camouflage trucker hat, is one of them.\"Many people, they are not dying because of the virus, they are dying because of another disease,\" he says. He adds that some of the families who bought coffins told him their loved one were vaccinated.He adds that some of the families who bought coffins told him their loved ones were vaccinated.Dire situationVaccine skepticism is such a problem that the government has now legally mandated civil servants to get vaccinated. The local county governor agrees that more has to be done to get shots into arms.\"Yes, I will admit, the situation is dire. We have not been here before,\" Nyeri County Governor Mutahi Kahiga tells CNN from the driveway of his well-manicured, gated property on the edge of town.Not only are hospitals turning patients away, but many people only seek out medical attention when its too late.\"That tells you clearly that our people are doing self-medication at home. And that is dangerous. Because by the time you get to the hospital, you are gasping for oxygen, your oxygen levels are too low. We dont have enough oxygen and we may end up losing you,\" said Kahiga.Nyeri, a largely rural area with a population of less than one million, has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, at 6.2% of adults, second only to Nairobi.Even so, the governor says that more than a third of the police officers, teachers and senior citizens who were given the first dose of the vaccine failed to come back for the second.Many others dont want the vaccine at all. In some Kenyan counties, the vaccination rate is less than 0.5%. Nationally, its less than 2%.\"We have more than 40 tribes, with different traditions, beliefs, and taboos,\" Kahiga says. \"I think with Covid-19, some of us are still in denial, they are still holding on to traditional beliefs that cut across Africa... thats why we may be where we are.\"At the moment, the county has only 1,000 doses of the vaccine on hand -- to distribute to 28 vaccination sites. The central government will only send more once theyve all been used.But as the virus continues its deadly surge, some attitudes are changing. At a vaccination site in the capital, Nairobi, earlier this month, 24-year-old Olendo Obondo told CNN she \"wasnt concerned for a long time\" about the virus, until the Delta variant started filling up hospitals and morgues. That was enough to convince her to get vaccinated.\"Death can convince me. If this can prevent me from dying, hopefully, then Id rather take it.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/08/24/africa/kenya-vaccine-hesitancy-coffins-cmd-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "How a US group with links to the far-right may have influenced a crackdown on Ghana's LGBTQ community", "data_published": "2021-10-08T04:06:37Z", "content": "Accra, Ghana (CNN) A safe house was the only place Joe felt protected enough to meet.Tucked away in a neighborhood of Accra, off Aflao Road, a group of Ghanaian gay activists use the house to gather in secret and provide shelter to LGBTQ people in need.Sitting on the corner of a couch in the gloomy interior, Joe holds a small clutch in both hands and speaks with a quiet defiance.\"I cant change the way I am. I cant change who I am,\" he says. \"This is natural, and it is how I feel. But we are dead. We are all now dead. We cant go out again and we cant mingle with our friends again.\"It wasnt supposed to be like this in Ghana.For years, Ghanaian LGBTQ activists felt they had made progress. They witnessed a quiet tolerance, especially in larger cities, and believed that their rights would continue to evolve.But within weeks, Ghanas parliament is set to debate a draft bill -- framed in the guise of \"family values\" -- which seeks to introduce some of the harshest anti-LGBTQ laws on the African continent.The prospect of it passing is pushing the countrys LGBTQ community into the shadows.LGBTQ Ghanaians have been left asking how things got so bad, so quickly, and Western diplomats say they have been caught by surprise.But what one Ghanaian activist calls a \"homophobes dream bill\" has deep roots in Ghanas religious community. It also found key inspiration from a US ultra-conservative group with Russian ties.Humiliated on cameraJoes path to the safe house began in his hometown, several hours drive from the capital. CNN agreed to identify him only by his assumed first name, because he fears for his safety.One evening several months ago, Joe says he was accosted on the street by a group of men who accused him of approaching one of their male relatives.\"I was shaking when they took me to that room and they took out their cameras. I was shaking and I was crying,\" he told CNN.Hiding in a safe house in Accra, Ghana, Joe, a homophobic attack victim describes to CNN how a group of men kidnapped him and physically and mentally abused him for being gay.He says the men took him to an abandoned construction site for interrogation.In a grainy video, seen by CNN, they bark at him in Fante dialect: \"Is it true that you told him that you like him?\"\"Yes,\" Joe replies meekly, shivering in the concrete room.Later in the clip, Joe is seen crouching on the ground as he is repeatedly kneed in the head by one of his attackers.When videos of Joes ordeal were shared on social media several months later, he says his father threw him out of the family home.\"When I saw the video. I was like, it is better to kill myself, but I had nowhere to go,\" he says.LGBTQ activists say what happened to Joe is part of a pattern of abuse seen in Ghana over several years. Video after video show Ghanaians -- mostly men perceived as being gay -- being harassed and beaten on camera, sometimes stripped naked by their assailants. Lesbian and trans Ghanaians are also targeted, say activists, but most attacks go unreported.Although some are harassed and shamed publicly, these attitudes were not universal; activists speak of regular LGBTQ-friendly parties held in Accra being advertised openly on social media.A Human Rights Watch report from 2018 found that Ghana had a mixed record in its treatment of LGBTQ Ghanaians.Old sodomy laws dating back to 1960 remain on the statute books in Ghana -- as they do across much of Africa -- but they are rarely, if ever, enforced.This year, that could all change.A door opens, then is shutMulticolored balloons and rainbow umbrellas decorated Ghanas first LGBTQ support center, in Accra, for its grand opening in January. Diplomats from several European nations and Australia attended, and LGBTQ Ghanaians said they couldnt believe the progress Ghana had made.The backlash was immediate. Traditional leaders, church groups, and lawmakers flooded social media, rushed to local TV stations, and used their pulpits to excoriate the center, blaming its existence on Western influence and claiming it was an attempt to \"recruit\" young Ghanaians.Many of the critics are part of a loosely-configured group known as the National Coalition for Proper Human Sexual Rights and Family Values.\"We knew that there would be opposition, but we didnt think it would be of this magnitude,\" says Alex Kofi Donkor, director of LGBT+ Rights Ghana, the group that opened the center. \"The whole country seemed to be talking about it.\"The resulting public outcry led to a police raid, and the center was closed less than a month after it had opened.Soon afterward, plans for the draconian new anti-LGBTQ law began to emerge. The bill was introduced in parliament in early August.The draft \"Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill\" -- a copy of which has been obtained by CNN -- would see LGBTQ Ghanaians face jail time, or be coerced into so-called \"conversion therapy\" -- a widely discredited practice debunked by much of the international medical and psychiatric communities.Under the bill, advocates of the LGBTQ community would face up to a decade in prison; public displays of same-sex affection or cross dressing could lead to a fine or jail time, and certain types of medical support would be made illegal.The new law would also make the distribution of material deemed pro-LGBTQ by news organization or websites illegal. It calls on Ghanaians to turn over those they suspect of being from the LGBTQ community.\"It is against our culture, it is against our norms, it is against our tradition,\" says Emmanuel Kwasi Bedzrah, one of the members of parliament (MPs) whose name is on the bill. \"We dont want things that are against our sensibility to be given priority in our society and therefore this will be a deterrent to anyone who supports them.\"Standing outside Ghanas imposing parliament complex as a bank of dark clouds threatens to break the intense heat, the MP says: \"In the beginning of this year we had a group of people in the guise of an NGO trying to lure people into their fold. We noticed that it [being a member of the LGBTQ community] is spreading like wildfire in the country.\"\"We love them, we are asking them not to do it,\" Bedzrah says as the cloud breaks, rain battering the giant black star of Ghanas flag outside of the Speakers office.Just a short drive from parliament, we meet a prominent gay activist at Accras Black Star Square, where an arch commemorating Ghanas independence celebrates \"Freedom and Justice.\"Unlike the lawmakers CNN spoke to for this story, Danny Bediako is too afraid to use his real name -- or to speak in a public place.Bediako, who runs the NGO Rightify Ghana, denounced the claim that homosexuality is a Western import or that LGBTQ activists were out to recruit and convert straight Ghanaians.\"The same people they claim to have brought homosexuality to Africa are the same people who told them to have this hate they are using against us,\" he says. \"There have always been queer Ghanaians.\"Bediako says the anti-LGBTQ \"family values\" coalition has long been a loud presence in Ghana, but that it was never organized or particularly strategic.He believes that changed when a US group promoting those same \"family values\" organized a conference in Accra in late 2019 -- just before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\"The US right-wing people were here and after that there was a rush to push legislation,\" Bediako says.The conference was hosted by the World Congress of Families, which Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ rights group, calls \"one of the most influential American organizations involved in the export of hate.\"The genesis of the lawThe 2019 conference was largely organized in response to proposals by the Ghanaian government to create a comprehensive sex education curriculum, to teach young people about the emotional, physical and social aspects of sexuality. This plan was later shelved.But audio recordings, presentations, and action plans of the meeting, reviewed by CNN, show that much of the conferences time was focused on the supposed \"dangers\" of LGBTQ influence, labeling it as a grand left-wing conspiracy out to destroy \"family values.\"One of the highlights of the conference, for attendees, was the presence of US ultra-conservative organizer Brian Brown, the president of the World Congress of Families (WCF).Brown made a name for himself pushing Californians to outlaw same-sex marriage at the ballot. He continues to lead the National Organization for Marriage and heads up a digital fundraising effort for right-wing Republican Party candidates in the US.A group of gay men walking on a street in Accra, they met in this neighborhood to attend a wake party for a member of their community.The WCF has curious beginnings: It was founded in the late 1990s as a collaboration between US religious conservatives and right-wing Russians, after the fall of the Soviet Union.But in recent years, in conferences from Hungary to Croatia, Tbilisi, Georgia; to Verona, Italy , the group has become increasingly influential in organizing anti-LGBTQ forces and inspiring policy initiatives, according to Neil Datta, secretary of the European Parliamentary Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Rights.Datta recently authored extensive research on anti-LGBTQ groups in Europe that included data about the alleged funding of the WCFs activities.\"The World Congress of Family conferences are like an incubator for bad ideas,\" says Datta. \"Different religious extremists from different parts of the world meet and exchange ideas and then people take those ideas and expand on it at the national level.\"He says several pieces of legislation and petitions in Eastern Europe appear to have flowed from WCF meetings.\"The fact that the WCF took place in Accra in 2019 and now we have something appearing as a draft bill is not surprising. This draft \"Family Values\" bill seems to be one more iteration of the homophobic initiatives emanating from their conferences,\" he says.At WCFs Accra conference, the delegates proposed the formation of legal teams to mount constitutional and legal challenges within six months to a year. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, their timeline wasnt far off.But Brown insists that his organization provides inspiration, not instruction.\"In each of these countries people are saying enough is enough with Western countries coming in and saying we are going to redefine the family,\" he told CNN from his office in Washington D.C.Brown says the WCF had nothing to do with writing the Ghanaian bill: \"You dont need to look for a bogeyman, it is going to come from the people themselves and there is a huge opportunity for stronger global ties.\"That inspiration seems apparent when Ghanaians pushing the bill use strikingly similar talking points to Browns organization, including a near obsession with the \"natural\" family as a way to propagate generational Christian conservative values.Roman Catholic Archbishop Philip Naameh told CNN that being LGBT is against Christian and Ghanaian values and that it could make the Muslim population of Ghana a majority and potentially turning Ghana into an Islamic State.\"Those who are promoting gays and lesbians are not going to have children at all, and within a short time nobody should be surprised that Muslims will become a majority in this country and declare it an Islamic state,\" Archbishop Philip Naameh, the president of the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference, told CNN. He welcomes the support of WCF.But some activists believe a crackdown on LGBTQ rights was waiting to happen with or without a nudge from US conservatives, because of growing discontent within the religious community in Ghana.In a massive online prayer rally in March entitled: \"Homosexuality: a detestable sin to God,\" pastors at the millions-strong Pentecostal Church said it was a matter of \"national security\" to pass a law; they continue to push members of parliament to follow through with their plans.The Pentecostal Churchs leadership repeatedly refused CNNs requests for an interview.The damage is already doneMembers of parliament and activists say the draft bill will be debated and likely voted on after Ghanas parliament reopens in late October. Based on CNNs reporting, it appears to have strong support -- even among more moderate MPs.The bill may end up being watered down in the amendment process. It will also need to be signed by President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is likely to face harsh condemnation from Western donors if it comes into law.The bill places Western nations in a difficult position. Already heavily criticized for supporting the opening of the LGBTQ center earlier this year, the European Union and Australian missions would not speak to CNN on the record.The US did not have a representative at the opening, but one of the Biden administrations first acts was to formally task its agencies with combating anti-LGBTQ legislation globally.A State Department spokesperson told CNN the US government was concerned with the increasing rhetoric and actions that threaten the LGBTQ community in Ghana.\"We are monitoring the situation closely,\" the State Department statement said. \"We urge national leaders in Ghana to uphold constitutional protections and to adhere to Ghanas international human rights obligations and commitments for all individuals.\"But for many activists, the damage is already done.In late May, more than 20 participants in an LGBTQ paralegal training session organized by One Love Sisters, Ghana and Key Watch Ghana were arrested for \"unlawful assembly\" in the countrys southeastern Volta region.One of those present, a 21-year-old intersex woman, who has asked CNN to identify her by the pseudonym Edem Amavor because she fears for her safety, told CNN she was physically and sexually assaulted by police in a horrifying ordeal.Intersex people have natural variations in reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male.\"I was taken to a male cell,\" she recalls. \"The officers told the men in the cell to rape me since I insisted I was a female.\"Volta regional police spokesman Sgt. Prince Dogbatse told CNN that: \"No such reports have come to the attention of the Command,\" but that they would investigate the matter.Another of those detained was Eddy Oppong, also using a pseudonym because of safety concerns.He was among those detained and released after 22 days , after charges against the paralegal group were dropped in early August.\"People are scared,\" says Danny Bediako. \"People are feeling insecure to even go into public spaces and hold meetings for their organizations. Some people have stopped their support entirely.\"He says he is now trying to hold support groups online.Bediako says LGBTQ activists have submitted memoranda to parliament to lessen the blow from the proposed new law, and they are trying to speak to MPs to encourage them to weaken the bills provisions, but he fears few politicians will be brave enough to engage with them in the current climate -- even if lives are at stake.\"The people who suspect us are waiting for the bill to be passed so they can beat us up and hand us over to the police,\" he said.He believes that the limited space that Ghanaians from the LGBTQ community had to be themselves may soon vanish and that the precipitous drop in rights seen in recent months could become a permanent feature.Joe, the gay Ghanaian who was beaten and thrown out of his home, spent just a few days at the safe house in Accra before moving on. He says he wishes he hadnt been born in Ghana.And he has a message for the MPs and religious leaders fronting the bill: \"We are all human beings. Their sons and their daughters can be like me. They can face the same thing, like the way those guys did to me.\"\"I want to ask: If their daughters and their sons have been through this -- will they allow the law to take them to jail? My answer to them is they should put a stop to it.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/10/08/africa/ghana-lgbtq-crackdown-intl-cmd/index.html"}, {"title": "Death of a 15-year-old girl while giving birth exposes dark practice of child marriage in Zimbabwe", "data_published": "2021-10-11T14:37:07Z", "content": "CNN has changed the names of the young girls interviewed for this article because of safety concerns.(CNN) Faith and her other teenage friends sit outside in the bright sun while waiting for their Taekwondo session to start in Epworth, a township southeast of central Harare.Her son and the babies of other teenage mothers play together in the dirt while the mothers wait for their instructor.They speak in low tones about the circumstances that led to the death of 15-year-old Anna Machaya during childbirth in July.

A petition against child marriage has garnered thousands of signatures, and many campaigners hope her case will expose the practice of child marriage which is outlawed in the country but has continued, despite the threat of legal action.According to the campaign group, Girls Not Brides in Zimbabwe , over a third of girls are married before the age of 18 and 5% are married before their 15th birthday.Husband and parents arrestedFollowing the outcry generated by Machayas case, Momberume was arrested along with Machayas parents, Zimbabwe police spokesperson Paul Nyathi told CNN.Momberume is facing rape charges, while her parents have been charged with obstructing the course of justice for allegedly providing false identification documents to the police concealing her real age, Nyathi said.Authorities allege that Machayas parents, Edmore Machaya and Shy Mabika, also promised to give a 9-year-old to Momberume.\"Our investigations have shown that people involved are not opening up, and they are trying to sweep things under the carpet, particularly on what activities could be taking place in that church,\" Nyathi told CNN.Alice Mabika, speaking on behalf of Annas family, declined to comment when contacted by CNN about the incident.\"I have been asked not to comment on this issue until the investigations are done,\" she said.The government has typically turned a blind eye to the practice of child marriage. Zimbabwe has two sets of marriage laws, the Marriage Act and Customary Marriages Act. Neither law gives a minimum age for marriage consent, while the customary law allows polygamy.A new marriages bill that is before parliament for debate seeks to synchronize the laws, ban the marriage of anyone below 18 years and prosecute anyone involved in the marriage of a minor.A church under scrutinyThe practice of child marriage is widespread in townships and rural Zimbabwe, where most of the countrys poor live, and where parents often say theyre forced to give away their young daughters in marriage to reduce the burden of their upkeep.The Apostolic church has also come under scrutiny as young girls are encouraged to marry older men, for \"spiritual guidance,\" according to Girls Not Brides.Human Rights Watch said child marriage is \"rampant\" among some apostolic churches.\"Child marriage is rampant in Zimbabwe, especially among Indigenous apostolic churches, an evangelical group that mixes Christian beliefs with traditional cultures and has millions of followers across the country, \" HRW said in a post.One teen mother told CNN she got married at15 and is struggling to make ends meet.Nyasha Marange, a spokesperson for the Johanne Marange Apostolic Church where Anna died, said the church did not allow marriage involving children under 18 years and denied that its members were abusing minors.\"Our leaders have been preaching against that,\" Marange told CNN.\"We excommunicate any member who engages in such behavior. It is a criminal offense and should be dealt with at the courts like in Momberumes case,\" he told CNN.He said that the teenager died in the shrine owned by the church but not inside the church premises. According to him, the Zimbabwe government banned church gatherings to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and that regular church services have not been held since.The shrine is where members perform prayers and receive spiritual instruction from the church leader. It is said to be sacred as it carries spiritual power, according to the church authorities.Marange added that the church cooperated with police and church members helped in finding Momberume when he allegedly went into hiding following her death.Parents rarely report cases of abuse to the police for fear of \"embarrassing\" the church, according to Zimbabwe Council of Churches general secretary Kenneth Mtata.Mtata told CNN that child abusers in these churches when apprehended, rarely face consequences.\"At the moment, we have many cases where sentencing seems not to be happening, and many people get away with it,\" Mtata said.Lockdown causes rise in teenage pregnanciesThe Covid-19 lockdown last year has led to an increase in teenage marriages, campaigners told CNN.Many schoolgirls were forced to stay at home, which saw child marriage increase, according to Natsiraishe Maritsa, whose initiative is teaching teenage mothers self-defense lessons in Epworth, one of the poorest townships in southern Harare.\"Most school-going children have nothing to do because schools are closed. That is pushing them into early marriages,\" Maritsa told CNN.Between January and February 5 this year, nearly 5,000 teenagers became pregnant while 1,174 child marriages were recorded, Zimbabwes Womens Affairs Minister Sithembiso Nyoni told the countrys parliament in March.Womens minister Nyoni said officials were collecting data compiling statistics on teen pregnancies, adding that rural areas were the most affected.\"We havent had an update yet, but in rural parts of Zimbabwe, the pregnancies are not going down as expected. We are still compiling the data, and hopefully, we can see the scale. Men should stop this behavior,\" she said.She also called on authorities to take action against churches abusing teen girls.\"We are saying all those churches abusing children should be brought to book. We want all those churches which start things in the name of God to be responsible and not abuse children,\" Nyoni told CNN.A life of pain and penuryEarly marriage and a lack of qualifications often condemn young girls to a life of pain and penury.Faith told CNN her parents forced her to marry a 26-year-old man after dropping out of school at 15.She says shes lost all hope of ever going back to school. Faiths husband works at a gold mine and the couple often do not see each other for weeks. What they both earn from their low-paid jobs can barely sustain the family.\"I survive by doing menial jobs. It is hard to get soap to wash my childs clothes. This is a tough life,\" she sighed.Spiwe 17, is a friend of Faiths. She told CNN she got married at 15 after her parents divorced.Arimuzhu makes less than $2 a day doing laundry and other house chores for the citys middle-class workers.

And he doesn't say a word", "data_published": "2021-10-02T07:03:32Z", "content": "(CNN) When Italy first went into a coronavirus lockdown last year, Khabane Lame had just lost his job at a factory near the northern city of Turin.He spent his days holed up at his parents home in Chivasso with his three siblings, looking for other jobs. One day, he downloaded TikTok and started tinkering with it in his bedroom, posting videos of himself under the name Khaby Lame . And gradually, a surprising career was born.At first, like a lot of TikTokers, he created clips of himself dancing, watching video games or doing comedy stunts. Then, earlier this year, he began making fun of the life-hack videos that flood social media platforms -- reacting to them with a wordless shrug or a look of exasperation -- and he struck a chord.Now Lame (prounouced Lah-MAY) is the most popular man on TikTok, with 114 million followers . The only other person ahead of him is dancer Charli DAmelio , a California teen who posts playful videos, often with her older sister Dixie.And Lame, 21, does it all without saying a word. On TikTok, his silence speaks volumes.\"I came up with the idea because I was seeing these videos circulating, and I liked the idea of bringing some simplicity to it,\" Lame told CNN in a recent video interview.\"The type of gesture came by chance, but the silence didnt. I thought of a way to reach as many people as possible. And the best way was not to speak.\"His videos have a singular styleLame is a slender Senegalese man with long limbs and an expressive face. In most of his clips, he lampoons videos of people doing overly complicated hacks by responding with a simplified, more logical way of doing the same task.His reactions personify the term \"shaking my head,\" or SMH in internet shorthand. After his common-sense approach to a task, Lame extends his arms with his palms facing upward, as if to say duh. Sometimes he throws in an eye roll or a shake of the head.These silent but expressive reactions have made him one of the most recognizable digital creators on social media.\"Maybe because my facial expressions are funny and they make people laugh, this simplicity makes people laugh and I love it,\" Lame said.One marketer says the popularity of Lames videos show how nonverbal communication can transcend language barriers and make connections across cultures.\"You dont need to speak to be seen or understood,\" said Christina Ferraz, founder of Houston-based marketing agency Thirty6five . \"His exasperation is relatable, and feelings are universal.\"He sends a message that life need not be complicatedLames deadpan humor has attracted fans from all over the world, who regularly send him videos of people performing simple tasks in complicated ways.\"They know Im the one who solves problems so they tag me or mention me and theyre like, Khaby its your turn, solve this problem because we need you,\" he said.His stoic facial expressions have also turned him into a meme star -- with his face reposted in reaction videos on social media.Unlike some other social media stars, Lames videos are not overproduced. They appear organic and use simple actions and imagery to convey humor, which boosts his authenticity and reinforces his point about making life less complicated, Ferraz said.She also believes his content resonates with people because he rose to fame during a time when the world was on lockdown from quarantine.Khaby Lame speaks at an Italian Tech Week event on September 24, 2021, in Turin, Italy.\"People were scouring social media for both escapism and connection,\" Ferraz said. \"The lack of verbal communication allows the audience to focus only on his actions, and no other meaning can be applied other than what he is literally doing or expressing.\"To her, Lames videos reveal how often we make life more difficult or complicated than necessary. I think most people prefer to keep things simple.\"Lame is one of the fastest-growing content creators on TikTok. Hes gaining an average of almost 200,000 followers a day and is on pace to eclipse the platforms most popular star, according to Social Blade, which tracks social media analytics.But Lame said thats not why he started posting videos.\"I dont care if Im first or second or fourth most popular on TikTok. I started making videos because I wanted to make people laugh in that period of lockdown,\" he said. \"And I keep making videos with the same ideals. Im happy about my accomplishments, but those are not my main things.\"His popularity has opened international doorsLike his popularity, Lames background transcends different continents.He was born in Senegal and moved to Italy with his parents when he was a year old. He spent most of his life in public housing, which he credits with shielding him from racism and exposing him to the world beyond Italy.\"There we were people from every ethnicity, so we would protect each other a lot. There was never an issue about racism,\" he said.While hes not yet an Italian citizen, he speaks fluent Italian and said he considers the country home. Hes applied for citizenship and as he awaits the process to go through, he said its been hard for him to travel to events in the United States and other countries on his Senegalese passport.Lame says, \"I started making videos because I wanted to make people laugh.\"Lame declined to say how much money he makes from the partnerships, although the biggest social media stars can earn millions of dollars a year from their content.He said his biggest purchase since he became famous is an iPhone 12 so he can shoot better videos. \"Im not buying anything crazy,\" he said.But his life is a far cry from his days -- only 18 months ago -- as a jobless young man living with his parents. He says his mother and father are proud of his success.\"It was unexpected (for them) just like for the rest of the world. So they got into the perspective (of me being famous) quite late. And me too. You dont realize whats happening to you,\" he said. \"They didnt have any set idea of what they wanted me to become when I was a child -- the important thing is that I was happy, and had a good job.\"Lame now lives with his agent in Milan. His posts get thumbs-ups from celebrities, including his idol, actor Will Smith.And as more TikTok stars sign deals with movie companies, Lame hopes to accomplish a childhood dream and work with Smith on a project.Meanwhile, hell continue crushing ridiculous life hacks -- with his deadpan silence.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/10/02/world/tiktok-khaby-lame-cec/index.html"}, {"title": "Ethiopia used its flagship commercial airline to transport weapons during war in Tigray", "data_published": "2021-10-06T04:03:02Z", "content": "(CNN) Ethiopias government has used the countrys flagship commercial airline to shuttle weapons to and from neighboring Eritrea during the civil war in Ethiopias Tigray region , a CNN investigation has found.Cargo documents and manifests seen by CNN, as well as eyewitness accounts and photographic evidence, confirm that arms were transported between Addis Ababas international airport and airports in the Eritrean cities of Asmara and Massawa on board multiple Ethiopian Airlines planes in November 2020 during the first few weeks of the Tigray conflict.Its the first time this weapons trade between the former foes has been documented during the war. Experts said the flights would constitute a violation of international aviation law, which forbids the smuggling of arms for military use on civil aircraft.Atrocities committed during the conflict also appear to violate the terms of a trade program that provides lucrative access to the United States market and which Ethiopian Airlines has benefited greatly from.Ethiopian Airlines is a state-owned economic powerhouse that generates billions of dollars a year carrying passengers to hubs across the African continent and all over the world, and it is also a member of the Star Alliance, a group of some of the worlds top aviation companies.The airline has issued multiple denials about transporting weapons.On Thursday, Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement that it \"strongly refutes\" the findings of CNNs latest investigation. \"To the best of its knowledge and its records, it has not transported any war armament in any of its routes by any of its aircraft,\" the airline said, echoing previous denials.The statement said \"alleged pictures\" in CNNs report are not known to Ethiopian Airlines. It also focused on one entry in cargo documents that said \"food stuff and refill,\" saying that the goods were \"declared on the document as per IATA standards.\"The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea did not respond to CNNs requests for comment.JUST WATCHED Ethiopian Airlines carried weapons for its government Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ethiopian Airlines carried weapons for its government 04:15Military refillsLong-simmering tensions between Ethiopias government and the ruling party in the Tigray region exploded on November 4, when Ethiopia accused the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front of attacking a federal army base.Abiy Ahmed , Ethiopias Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, ordered a military offensive to oust the TPLF from power. Government forces and regional militias poured into Tigray, joined on the front lines by troops from Eritrea.Documents obtained by CNN indicate that flights carrying weapons between Ethiopia and Eritrea began at least as early as a few days after the outset of the Tigray conflict.Air waybill showing transportation of RIFFLE & DFS -- in reference to rifles and dry foodstuffs per airline sources -- on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on November 12.On at least six occasions -- from November 9 to November 28 -- Ethiopian Airlines billed Ethiopias ministry of defense tens of thousands of dollars for military items including guns and ammunition to be shipped to Eritrea, records seen by CNN show.The documents, known as air waybills, detail the contents of each shipment. In one document, the \"nature and quantity of goods\" is listed as \"Military refill\" and \"Dry food stuff.\" Other entries included the description \"Consolidated.\" The records also had abbreviations and spelling mistakes such as \"AM\" for ammunition and \"RIFFLES\" for rifles, according to airline employees. They told CNN the spelling errors were introduced when the contents were manually entered by employees into the cargo database.Ethiopian Airlines cargo manifest for the same flight carrying rifles on November 12.Benno Baksteen, chairman of DEGAS, the Dutch Expert Group Aviation Safety, told CNN that these waybills were required for all commercial flights as the crew on board need to know the contents of the cargo to ensure they are transported safely.On November 9, five days after Abiy ordered a military offensive in Tigray, records show an Ethiopian Airlines flight transported guns and ammunitions from Addis Ababa to Asmara, Eritreas capital.An air waybill and a cargo manifest from that date show that Ethiopian Airlines charged Ethiopia $166,398.32 for about 2,643 pieces of \"DFS & RIFFLE WITH AM (sic)\" on that flight. DFS is a reference to \"dry food stuff,\" according to airline sources.Air waybill showing military refill being transported on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on November 13.Another air waybill from a few days later, November 13, has the same shipper and consignee. The content of that shipment was \"military refill and dry food stuff,\" according to the document. The shipments came at a time of increased military activity; security sources in the region told CNN the Eritreans needed re-supply for the fight in Tigray.As planes went back and forth between the two countries, massacres of Tigrayans in the city of Axum and the village of Dengelat by Eritrean troops took place on November 19 and November 30 respectively.Cargo documents show that the series of flights between Ethiopia and Eritrea continued until at least November 28, 2020.Some current and former Ethiopian Airlines employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions, said the flights continued past this date but that the majority of arms trips to Eritrea were in November.Both cargo and passenger planes were used in the operation, though CNN has no evidence that commercial passengers were on any of the flights carrying weapons. Many of these flights do not appear on popular online flight tracking platforms such as Flightradar24. When they do, the destination in Eritrea is often not visible and the flight path vanishes once the plane crosses the border from Ethiopia.The employees told CNN the staff could manually turn off the ADS-B signal on board to prevent the flights being publicly tracked.The flights were often assigned the same flight numbers, primarily ET3312, ET3313 and ET3314, with ET being the code for Ethiopian Airlines. All the planes mentioned in the cargo files seen by CNN are American-made Boeing aircraft. The airline has been in a long relationship with the US aviation giant.A Boeing representative declined to comment.Ethiopian Airlines workers described witnessing other airline employees loading and unloading arms and military vehicles on flights directed to Asmara. A few even claimed they helped load the weapons on the planes themselves. All spoke of being ethnically profiled for being Tigrayan.CNN has seen the Ethiopian Airlines ID cards of these employees and confirmed their identities.One former employee told CNN they were instructed at Addis Ababas Bole International Airport to load guns and four military vehicles onto an Ethiopian Airlines cargo plane that was due to fly to Belgium but was sent instead to Eritrea.\"The cars were Toyota pickups which have a stand for snipers,\" the employee said. \"I got a call from the managing director late at night informing me to handle the cargo. Soldiers came at 5 a.m. to start loading two big trucks loaded with weapons and the pickups.\"\"I had to stop a flight to Brussels, a 777 cargo plane, which was loaded with flowers, then we unloaded half of the perishable goods to make space for the armaments.\"The former employee warned soldiers that the vehicles were carrying far more gas than was allowed under international air transport rules, but said they were overruled after a direct call from an army commander.\"He [the commander] said we are going to war and we need the fuel to be loaded,\" the employee said. \"Then I referred the issue to my manager and my manager took responsibility and allowed them to load it.\"The flight, loaded with both weapons and flowers, traveled to Eritrea, then returned to Addis before flying on to Brussels the following day, the employee said. CNN cross-referenced this testimony with Flightradar24 and found the record of an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft returning from the direction of Eritrea and flying to Brussels the next day, but could not independently verify it was the same flight referred to by the employee.Days later, the employee said they were temporarily suspended from work. They believe they were suspended for being Tigrayan but also for the incident with the soldiers. The employee fled Ethiopia in March.Ethiopian Airlines told CNN in its statement that no employees had been suspended or terminated due to their ethnic background.It appears to be not the only long-distance international flight with unplanned stops. A flight from Addis Ababa to Shanghai on November 9, 2020, took a long detour via Eritrea according to the ADS-B signal that tracks the route on Flightradar24.Several employees at the Addis Ababa airport said they saw multiple weapons flights leave for Eritrea each day at the outset of the conflict. They also spoke about flights carrying weapons from Eritrea back to Ethiopia. Its unclear why armaments were being transferred back to Ethiopia.One said they saw tanks and heavy artillery loaded onto planes coming to Addis Ababa, while small arms -- mortars, launchers -- were dispatched to Asmara. Employees told CNN they believed the smaller weaponry were being sent to Asmara to arm Eritrean troops.All the employees said they were instructed by the airline to delete photos of the weapons from their phones. Not all of them did.In June, photos circulated on social media platforms showing crates containing mortars on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight and the same crates being loaded on the plane in Massawa, Eritrea.The company released a statement strongly denying the allegation that its planes were transporting weapons and claimed the photos were photoshopped.However, CNN has corroborated the photos using visual analysis techniques, interviews and documentary evidence, dating them to a 777 Freighter cargo flight that flew from Ethiopia to Eritrea and back between November 8 and 9.The images show a variety of mortars stacked up in the crates. Dan Kaszeta, a London based defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, identified the mortars as 832-DU 82mm mortar rounds, originally made in Russia but with many versions subsequently manufactured, including in Bulgaria.CNN has contacted the Bulgarian government and reached out to Bulgarian arms producers but received no response. According to the EUs public database, Bulgaria sold weapons to Ethiopia as recently as 2020.Another image features an employee wearing a uniform that matches with the Ethiopian Airlines uniform. The interior of the plane also fits the layout of an Ethiopian Airlines 777F cargo plane. The expiry date of the Emirates SkyCargo straps tightened around the crates -- November 2023 -- can be seen in the photos. Since these particular types of cargo straps -- TSO C172 -- have a lifespan of three years, they would have been used in November 2020 at the earliest. CNN has confirmed that these Emirates SkyCargo straps have been used on other Ethiopian Airlines flights. Emirates SkyCargo told CNN that its \"straps may be inadvertently mixed with those of other airlines by ground handlers, who are third-party contractors, and may be used to secure cargo transported on other aircraft.\"CNN has learned that the cargo plane in question took off on November 8 from Addis Ababa empty before landing in Massawa, where local workers were tasked with manually loading it with a variety of weapons, including these mortars.People are seen loading crates of weapons onto an Ethiopian Airlines plane at an airport in Massawa, Eritrea. Some faces have been blurred by CNN to preserve anonymity.A cargo manifest from that day, seen by CNN, confirms the flight was empty when it reached Massawa.A screenshot from the Ethiopian Airlines internal database taken by an employee and sent to CNN reveals a flight on November 8 to Massawa that is hidden from flight tracking sites. The weapons were then dropped in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, before the aircraft returned to Addis Ababa on November 9.A lot of legal repercussionsSeveral aviation experts CNN spoke to on these findings said Ethiopian Airlines appeared to be in violation of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly known as the Chicago Convention, which prohibits commercial carriers from transporting \"munitions of war or implements of war.\"Pablo Mendes de Leon, professor of air and space law at The Hague, told CNN there are several indications that these flights were commercial flights -- not military or state aircraft -- including \"that [the flights] carry a commercial flight number of Ethiopian Airlines in conjunction with the fact that an airway bill has been issued.\"\"I have now arrived at the conclusion that [these flights have] been operated by civil aircraft falling under the terms of the Chicago Convention,\" Mendes de Leon said, adding that CNNs findings \"have a lot of legal repercussions and conditions, all of which may not have been met.\"Ethiopias status as a regional economic powerhouse is partly dependent on Ethiopian Airlines dominance in cargo. The country and the airline have benefited from an American trade program that provides favorable access to the US market for countries that meet certain criteria.This relationship matters for both countries: in 2017, US exports to Ethiopia consisted primarily of aircraft and aircraft components from Boeing, valued at more than $857 million.But a clause in the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) stipulates that eligible nations must not engage in \"gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\"Previous CNN investigations found atrocities committed by the Ethiopian government and its allies bore the hallmarks of genocide and ethnic cleansing.In late August, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai warned Ethiopias chief trade negotiator that \"the ongoing violations of internationally recognized human rights\" in Tigray \"could affect Ethiopias future [AGOA] eligibility if unaddressed.\"On Tuesday, a spokesperson told CNN that Tais office would conduct its next review of eligibility for AGOA in 2022, \"based upon compliance with standards that include adherence to internationally recognized workers rights, rule of law, and human rights.\" After the review, Tai could \"possibly recommend that the President add or remove certain countries from AGOA beneficiary country status.\"This story has been updated to include a statement from Emirates SkyCargo, remove an erroneous reference to a cargo strap manufacturer and correct the spelling of the Ethiopian city of Bahir Dar.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/10/06/africa/ethiopian-airlines-investigation-tigray-war-intl-cmd/index.html"}, {"title": "Men are marched out of prison camps.

Witnesses on the ground say the bodies tell a dark story of mass detentions and mass executions across the border in Humera, a town in Ethiopias Tigray region.CNN has spoken with dozens of witnesses collecting the bodies in Sudan, as well as international and local forensic experts and people trapped and hiding in Humera, to reveal what appears to be a new phase of ethnic cleansing in Ethiopias war.A body is draped in plastic sheeting after being recovered from the river bank by Wad El Hilou, Sudan.Humera is one of many towns involved in the conflict that has ravaged the 112 million-strong east African country since the Ethiopian government launched an offensive in the countrys northern Tigray region in November 2020. Despite Prime Minister Abiy Ahmeds initial declaration of victory in late November, the region is still wracked by fighting and CNN has previously reported on the many atrocities including torture, extrajudicial killings , and the use of rape as a weapon of warAt the end of June this year, the balance of power shifted suddenly as Tigrayan forces recaptured the regional capital, Mekelle , and the Ethiopian government began withdrawing troops from the region. The fighting continued, however. In mid-July, Tigrayan forces announced a new offensive to recapture areas taken by the Ethiopian government.This new offensive, witnesses told CNN, was what prompted the government forces and militia groups holding the northern town of Humera, close to the border with Eritrea and Sudan, to launch a new phase of mass incarcerations of resident Tigrayans.CNNs investigations indicate that the ethnic profiling, detention and killing of Tigrayans bears the hallmarks of genocide as defined by international law, drawing statements of concern from UK and US officials.Were told to look out for the bodiesIn recent weeks, a community of Tigrayans living in the Sudanese town of Wad El Hilou, 65 kilometers (40 miles) downstream from Humera, has assumed the role of excavators and grave diggers for the bodies drifting down the river known in Sudan as the Setit and in Ethiopia as the Tekeze.It is arduous and distressing work. The stench from the bodies fills the air as they first extract each corpse from the riverbed and then dig new graves for them, before performing the burial rites.Tigrayan community leader Gebretensae Gebrekristos, also known as Gerri, helps coordinate and document the recovery of the bodies in Sudan.Gebretensae Gebrekristos, known as \"Gerri,\" is one of the communitys leaders; he helps coordinate the grim task with a solemn determination. In total the community estimates at least 60 bodies have been found so far. He explained how the group is certain the bodies are Tigrayans from Humera.\"We get calls from people in Humera that witnesses -- often escaped detainees -- saw people marched down to the river in one of the facilities and heard gunshots, or that a number of people were taken by soldiers from the detention facilities and never returned. Were told to look out for their bodies coming down the river.\"The bodies first appeared in Sudan in July when the river was at its highest volume due to the rainy season. Sudanese water engineers told CNN the speed of its flow then would enable the bodies to drift from Humera to Wad El Hilou in approximately two to three hours. Wad El Hilou is a natural pinch-point in the rivers path -- and so, when the bodies arrived, they floated towards the banks.According to Gerri, his community usually finds the exact number of bodies it has been told to expect.Sixteen-year-old Natay and 17-year-old Gebrey, whose names have been changed for their safety, are among the Tigrayans who said they fled prison camps in Humera. Now in Wad El Hilou, they confirmed to CNN that they heard reports of men, with their hands tied, being marched in single file towards the Humera riverfront, to the area between St. Marys and St. Michaels Church. The boys both say they heard shots ring out and the men did not return.Natay said he remembered feeling paralyzed: \"I was so fearful, thinking that they would kill me and throw me [in] too.\"Sudanese authorities in Wad El Hilou have filed police and coroner reports for each body found in their territory, documenting evidence of the extensive torture and \"execution-style\" bullet entry wounds found on many of the bodies, the authorities told CNN. Both local Sudanese authorities and forensic experts say all the bodies retrieved so far were likely dead before they hit the water.In a statement issued via US public relations firm Mercury, the Ethiopian government said it was investigating the allegations. \"In light of several inconsistencies in the allegations, we are working with the relevant authorities to gather evidence and will prosecute any individuals found to have committed crimes to the fullest extent of the law,\" a spokesperson said.\"The government is keen to reiterate our desire to ensure a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Tigray and is actively working to secure a ceasefire.\"Following CNNs investigation, a US State Department spokesperson said the agency is \"deeply alarmed at the escalating violence in northern Ethiopia\" and noted it continues to formally probe whether \"atrocity crimes\" have been committed in the region.\"Those responsible for human rights abuses and violations, as well as atrocities, must be held accountable through independent, transparent mechanisms,\" the spokesperson told CNN, adding that the department \"has a law and fact-based review underway on whether atrocity crimes have been committed in Tigray.\"Everyone was sickFor so many of the Tigrayans in Sudan, these bodies could have been people they knew. Many have fled from Humera and still have families there.Temesgen, 24, and Yonas, 25, say they escaped together from a warehouse in Humera, called Enda Yitbarek, which they describe as being used as a makeshift mass detention camp for thousands of Tigrayans. CNN has changed their names for their safety. They were both imprisoned for just over two weeks.\"I was playing around my house, then they collected me and took me because I am Tigrayan,\" Temesgen recalled. \"We didnt do anything, they just collected me and detained me.\"Inside the warehouse, people were crammed together on the floor without rooms or partitions to create privacy, he said.\"They werent providing us food and we didnt even have access to the toilet,\" Yonas said. \"Some people were toileting inside the warehouse.\"For Temesgen the real horror was the lack of medical assistance. \"Everyone was sick with flu and not getting medical help. They werent sending us to hospital,\" he said.Former detainees described to CNN prisoners of all ages squeezed tightly together -- from mothers with young children to teenagers to men in their 70s.Temesgen and Yonas say they escaped while on a rare toilet break permitted by the guards, and made the journey to Sudan. They both talked of multiple prison camps dotted around the city of Humera.CNN spoke to dozens of other escapees from these camps and, based on their accounts, estimates there are up to nine locations where it is thought thousands of Tigrayans are being detained.Ethnic profilingTigrayans still inside Humera told CNN that they live in constant fear of being detained or killed. They spoke of brazen ethnic profiling whereby residents of Tigrayan ethnicity are targeted and those of other ethnicities are safe, particularly those of the Amhara ethnicity; militia from Amhara have fought alongside Ethiopian government forces in Tigray.People of mixed ethnicity face an uncertain fate; residents told CNN that an Amhara ID card can suffice but to be seen socializing with Tigrayans will put someone at risk nonetheless.Alem, whose name has also been changed for security reasons, is half-Tigrayan but has a non-Tigrayan ID card and has been helping Tigrayans hide in his home in Humera while the arrests continue. Relatives abroad have urged him to flee, but he insists its his duty to stay and help those who are targeted.Rahel, not her real name, is also Tigrayan but has a non-Tigrayan ID card and says she has been visiting friends and relatives in the prison camps despite the questions posed by guards. She is horrified by the conditions for those detained.\"They cant move, they are not getting enough sanitation, no food, no water and no medicine. If they feel sick and die, no one cares. They are hungry and thirsty. How could they feel good thinking its their turn the next day, knowing their friends were killed yesterday? The guards dont care about life,\" she said.People in Humera who spoke to CNN repeatedly mentioned the disappearances of members of the Tigrayan community. Those still free assumed they were detained in the camps, but those who escaped from the prisons told CNN that people were frequently summoned by guards and would never return. Others spoke of rare sightings of bodies being dumped into the river.Across the water in Sudan, Yonas recalled the disappearances from the Enda Yitbarek warehouse.\"They werent torturing us but they were taking prisoners often at night and they never came back,\" Yonas said. \"We dont know whether they killed them or not, but after they took them they never came back, and their families reported their disappearances.\"Residents of Humera with whom CNN spoke firmly believe the bodies arriving in Wad El Hilou are from their town. Several are in regular touch with those who escaped across the border to Sudan and when the bodies began arriving, news spread fast.One man has been identified locally as Misganawu, a well-known barber in Humera. \"He had two nicknames, Totit and Gundi,\" Alem recalled. \"I knew Totit very well when he was working in Humera in that hairdressing shop. He was born and raised in Humera.\"Intent to killDr. Khalid Mohamed Khalid, a Sudanese forensics and identification expert, is best known for leading an investigation that implicated Sudanese security forces in the murder of protesters during the countrys 2018 revolution. Now, far from his pristine examination table, hes conducting his investigations on the banks of the Setit river.\"We were able to take six newly arrived bodies straight out the water and examine them. We found clear signs of a systematic manner of torture -- aggressive and painful violence with intent to kill. The victims were dead before they hit the water,\" he told CNN.Khlaid is working alongside international and other local forensic experts to produce a report on their findings.A draft of the report, obtained by CNN, dates the \"time of death\" of some of the bodies as falling between November 2020 and April 2021, meaning some executions occurred earlier than previously thought and were hidden from the world.The experts examinations were helped by the fact the corpses had effectively been preserved before entering the water, meaning they had not decomposed.The experts said it was impossible to state definitively at this point whether that preservation occurred naturally -- as a result of the environment the bodies were stored in -- or whether the bodies were intentionally preserved by their killers.\"The preservation was key to our findings,\" Dr Khalid said. \"The preservation process takes at least three months [to complete] -- and some were in very advanced stages of that process.\"The fact all the bodies were in a similar state indicates they were stored in a similar environment, possibly a storage facility or a mass grave, before being dumped into the river, experts said. Limited areas of decomposition on the victims bodies also helped shed further light on what happened after their death. The preservation also helped keep intact wounds, tattoos and other identifiers.Some of those found had their arms bound tightly behind their backs, in keeping with a torture technique called \"tabay.\" Several had their hands tied with small gauge yellow electrical wire and bone breakages and dislocations further indicate additional pressure was placed on their bodies before death.The experts say they are in a race against time to preserve evidence, in case it is needed for potential war crimes prosecutions in the future. They also confirmed the signs of torture apparent to the group in Sudan whove been collecting the corpses.A body recovered from the Setit River bank by Wad El Hilou, Sudan, is carried on plastic sheeting.While investigators in Sudan prepare to put forward their findings, Tigrayans and those helping them in Humera face a daily struggle to remain free from arrest and abuse.And Tigrayans like Gerri, on the other side of the border, mourn and dig shallow graves for the bodies that drift downstream.Speaking by the first riverside grave he dug, marked with a makeshift wooden cross, Gerri said it pained him to be unable to give them a proper burial.\"To leave your people by the river? Your sister, your brother, not laid properly to rest? When you see that, it hurts you, it hurts your heart, but what can you do? This is what we have been condemned to.\"International scrutinyDuring a debate this week in the UK parliament on the humanitarian crisis in Tigray, member of parliament for Dulwich and West Norwood Helen Hayes recently cited CNNs investigation, saying, \"There are sickening accounts of Tigrayans being held in prison camps near the Sudanese border, with reports from Sudan of corpses floating down the Setit river clearly identifiable as Tigrayans and showing signs of torture,\" Hayes said.\"This conflict contains the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and genocide,\" she said.A US State Department review of alleged atrocities in Tigray has been underway since at least late June. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Robert Godec told lawmakers at the time that the \"assessment is quite far advanced,\" and that the Biden administration had \"pushed it at a very accelerated pace.\"\"The administration is in full agreement that horrifying atrocities have been committed in Tigray and Secretary Blinken did say in earlier testimony, as youve said, that there were acts of ethnic cleansing,\" Godec said on June 29.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously announced sweeping visa restrictions on \"certain individuals responsible for, or complicit in, undermining resolution of the crisis in Tigray\" and the US sanctioned the chief of staff of the Eritrean Defense Forces for his connection to \"serious human rights abuse committed during the ongoing conflict in Tigray.\" The State Department has also \"imposed restrictions on foreign assistance for Ethiopia and have brought our defense trade control policy in line with this action,\" according to the spokesperson.\"Security assistance programs have been suspended. A planned Millennium Challenge Corporation economic growth threshold program also remains on hold at this time,\" they said.However, human rights campaigners and US-based Tigrayan advocates worry its not enough, telling CNN they are concerned that there have not been sanctions publicly announced against Ethiopian government officials, and that it continues to be a member of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), granting it hundreds of millions of dollars of favorable market access in the US.Just two weeks ago, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai \"raised the ongoing violations of internationally recognized human rights amid the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in northern Ethiopia\" in a conversation with Ethiopias Senior Policy Advisor and Chief Trade Negotiator Mamo Mihretu, and said those violations \"could affect Ethiopias future African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) eligibility if unaddressed,\" according to a readout from her office.USTR did not reply to CNNs requests for comment about Ethiopias future AGOA membership.The State Department spokesperson said the US government \"continues to consider use of the full range of policy tools available in response to the worsening crisis.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/05/africa/ethiopia-tigray-humera-sudan-bodies-cmd-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "Tani Adewumi: How chess changed the fortunes of 11-year-old prodigy and his family", "data_published": "2021-10-04T08:42:02Z", "content": "(CNN) When Tanitoluwa \"Tani\" Adewumi mulls his next move on a chessboard, his instinct is to pile pressure on his opponent.\"Im aggressive, I like to attack,\" he tells CNN Sport of his playing style. \"Its just the way I think in general: I want to checkmate my opponent as fast as I can.\"Tani, who turned 11 in September, is taking the same approach with his chess career. Having become a national master earlier this year -- the 28th youngest person to achieve that title -- he now wants to become the games youngest ever grandmaster.That record currently belongs to 12-year-old Abhimanyu Mishra , but Tani is putting in the hours to try to get there faster. He attends school in New York, then practices for seven hours when he gets home; when he doesnt have school, he can practice for eight, nine, or sometimes even 10 hours a day.His success in chess has so far yielded a growing collection of trophies, the most treasured of which is the title he won at the New York State chess championship in 2019 -- not necessarily because of the way he played, but because it changed his familys life forever.\"Thats the one that really boosted us up to become where we are today, and also me and my chess,\" says Tani.In June 2017, nearly two years before he won the state championship title, Tani and his family fled northern Nigeria, worried about attacks by extremist group Boko Haram.Tani Adewumi started playing chess seriously three years ago after his family moved to the US.They lived in a homeless shelter in Manhattan after moving to the United States, and shortly afterward Tani joined the chess club at his school, P.S. 116 in New York, on the agreement that the registration fee could be waived.When word spread of Tanis state championship title, an outpouring of financial support for his family followed.\"One family, they paid for a years rent in Manhattan, one family gave us in 2019 a brand-new Honda, and the Saint Louis Chess Club in Missouri invited the family and the coaches to come and pay a visit,\" Tanis father, Kayode Adewumi, who works as a real estate agent, tells CNN Sport.\"A lot of people really helped us, a lot of people gave us financial (support) and money ... they donated money for us to get out from the shelter.\"The family set up a GoFundMe page , which provided the housing, legal and educational funds needed to find their feet in the US. Further donations are being channeled into the Tanitoluwa Adewumi Foundation, which supports underprivileged children around the world.\"We need to give back to the needy, because we know what it takes -- weve tasted everything,\" adds Mr Adewumi.\"When we were in the shelter, some people are still there. We need to help the needy, especially the chess community and the people that need help. Thats why we put the money into the foundation, to help people.\"The family feels indebted to the sport of chess -- so much so that, through the foundation, they have contributed money to a chess organization in Africa encouraging more people to take up the game.Tani attends the Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards during the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival in New York.Tanis story bears similarities to Netflix series \"The Queens Gambit\" -- a fictional story about an orphaned Kentucky girl in the 1960s who becomes a chess champion in her teens. He has watched the series and says he \"definitely did\" see himself in it.\"Chess is everything to me, its my life,\" says Tani. \"Thats how we came to where we are today.\"But his early competitive experiences werent easy; when he played his first chess tournament, Tani lost all of his games.\"It did take me time, of course,\" he says. \"I believe it takes everybody time.\"Today, much of Tanis training involves watching the worlds best players -- the likes of reigning world champion Magnus Carlsen and grandmasters Hikaru Nakamura, Levon Aronian and Ian Nepomniachtchi. He studies how they think and how they plot each move.JUST WATCHED The Queens Gambit: How a Netflix show is increasing the popularity of chess Replay More Videos ...

If I didnt have to, I preferred not to eat with my family because then I could not study chess ... it must have been a lot of hours, but it was always because I loved it.\"To follow in Carlsens footsteps and reach the status of grandmaster -- the highest title in chess -- Tani will have to achieve three grandmaster norms -- an award given for a high level of performance in a chess tournament -- as well as earning an FIDE (Federation Internationale des Echecs) rating of 2,500.Wherever his chess career takes him, Tani can be sure that his familys support will never be far away. His mother accompanies him to his tournaments, and more recently, his father has been able to attend when he can fit it in around his work scheduleAs he watches his son emerge from his games, Mr Adewumi waits for a signal: thumbs up for a win, a horizontal thumb for a draw, and thumbs down for defeat. But whatever the result, his fathers reaction is always the same.\"When Im watching him playing, its just like your chest wants to burst out until it can be free,\" says Mr Adewumi. \"When he comes out ... we just grab him and are celebrating with him ... when hes lost the game, I embrace him, I encourage him.\"He has a philosophy that when you lose, you try again to work out what made you lose and encourage yourself to get better.\"That philosophy has reaped rewards so far, and it might yet help Tani Adewumi achieve the status of chess grandmaster.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/10/04/sport/tani-adewumi-chess-spt-intl-cmd/index.html"}, {"title": "Meet the Nigerian board game creator trying to change an industry", "data_published": "2021-09-22T09:33:40Z", "content": "Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Kenechukwu Cornelius Ogbuagu has been obsessed with playing and building games his entire life.As a child, he played board and card games including Snakes and Ladders Whot , and Ludo with the kids in his neighborhood in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria, where he was born and raised.Yet in a country that loves games such as chess and Scrabble -- even fielding a world champion Scrabble team -- Ogbuagu noticed a lack of Nigerian-made games. In 2013, he decided to create his own game while studying at the University of Calabar in southern Nigeria.\"There was a nationwide strike at government-owned universities in the country at the time, so nobody was going to class,\" Ogbuagu, now 29, says. With nothing to do, \"eventually, we started playing tabletop games.\"At the time, he was not sure how to create games, so he used cardboard, stones, and dice from an old Ludo game to make a dice rolling and card drafting game for him and his friends.Many of Ogbuagus friends in school enjoyed playing the game, inspiring him to turn his passion into a profession.Created in 2017, \"Homia\" is a memory and recognition game card game where players race to build their Nigerian home to win.Creating made-in-Nigeria gamesIn 2016, a few years after making his first game, Ogbuagu founded a game production publishing company called NIBCARD , which focuses on tabletop games such as board and card games.\"I eventually learned to make games on YouTube,\" he says. \"I learned how to make boards. I learned about direct imaging printers. I also found stores where I could get material to make the games I wanted.\"That same year, he started an annual convention in Abuja, Nigerias capital city, called the Africa Boardgame Convention , or \"AbCon\" -- a gathering of tabletop game lovers from across the country, which Ogbuagu says is the first of its kind in West Africa.\"Wan wan touch\" is a football-based board game. It was created in 2018.\"Many Nigerians hold stereotypes about board games. They say, oh, it is a womans game. The convention exists to cancel those types of stereotypes,\" Ogbuagu explains. Roughly 500 people attend the convention every year, he adds.But his big break came in 2017 when charity organization Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) hired NIBCARD to create 2,300 copies of a game called \"Luku Luku\" for an education project it was running in the country.Ogbuagu had been working with VSO as a volunteer when the group found out he was into games. \"I met British colleagues who liked to play card games. I became inspired by their games and wanted to make something like that in Nigeria,\" he says.Since making Luku Luku for VSO, Ogbuagu says NIBCARD has created at least two dozen tabletop games for sale across the country and received grants from organizations including the UNs International Organization for Migration (IOM).\"With the (IOM) grant, we were supposed to, in an artistic way, create an activity that will create awareness on migration,\" Ogbuagu says. To achieve this, he created a tile-placement game called \"My World Trip.\"\"Gbosi,\" debuting in 2018, is a tile placement war game.\"The game has maps of different countries and the names and continent of the countries,\" he explains. \"As players are jumping from country to country trying to win the game, they are forced to learn new countries that they probably have never heard of.\"Nigerias tabletop gaming industryAccording to a report in Dicebreaker , a publication focused on tabletop games, the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown period renewed interest in games and increased the sales of board games in places like the US and UK.In the same year, tabletop games successfully raised $236.6 million on Kickstarter, accounting for nearly a third of all the money made on the crowd-sourcing platform in 2020.But in Nigeria, there is hardly any data about the tabletop game industry. While games like chess, Ludo, and Scrabble are popular, the local sector is still largely untapped.Ogbuagu says one of the reasons the industry is struggling is because there arent a lot of board and card games designed and produced in the country.\"Many Nigerians dont have access to information about where to get games made in the country. There is also no access to tabletop games cafes and other value chains surrounding these games,\" he explains.It is difficult for the average Nigerian to find information about games, he adds: \"People will most likely know where to find Scrabble or chess than where to find their local, made-in-Nigeria games.\"A home-grown movementIn 2019, as a way of increasing that awareness, Ogbuagu opened a cafe in Abuja.\"The cafe is just a space filled with games. People can come there to play,\" he says, with 60 Nigerian-made board games and another 300 non-Nigerian games. \"Not all the games there are made by NIBCARD,\" he adds. \"We stock games from other people too.\"\"Hut Alive,\" created by Ogbuagu in 2017, is an elimination card game for up to six players.In the next couple of years, another goal is to get more people to appreciate and access locally made games, which starts with visibility.He says he is currently in talks with filmmakers from the country, encouraging them to swap games such as chess in their movies for Nigerian games like the ones NIBCARD produces.Hes also trying to reach the next generation of tabletop gamers, with \"volunteers that take our games to different schools across the country,\" Ogbuagu says. \"They teach children to play these games so that as they are growing up, they know that we have our own Nigerian games.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/22/africa/nigeria-ogbuagu-board-game-creator-spc-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "Why Africa is sending more satellites into space", "data_published": "2021-09-21T09:53:27Z", "content": "London (CNN Business) Africas space industry has been slow to take off, but its predicted to skyrocket in the next few years.Since the continents first satellite launched more than 20 years ago, 44 have been sent into orbit by 13 African countries, according to consultancy Space in Africa . It says a further 125 are being developed by 23 countries, all expected to launch before 2025.The payoff could be substantial. A 2021 report by the World Economic Forum estimates that data collected from space could unlock $2 billion a year in benefits for Africa.The report says satellites could address agricultural challenges by measuring crop health, improve water management by monitoring drought, and track tree cover for more sustainable forest management. In a continent where less than a third of the population has access to broadband, more communication satellites could help people connect to the internet.Addressing Africas challengesSouth African startup Astrofica was founded four years ago, providing space consultancy services. It supported the CubeSat program at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, which launched a constellation of maritime satellites for tracking ships along the southern African coast.Astroficas co-founder and CTO, Khalid Manjoo, says the goal of the startup is to use the space industry to address Africas challenges — from food security to national security.It hopes to launch its first constellation of satellites by the end of 2022, \"that will provide decision makers with critical data sets [in] near real time,\" according to Manjoo. He hopes the data will be used to monitor crop yield or track the use of fertilizers, as well as help governments with water management.The launch of South Africas SumbandilaSat on a Russian Soyuz rocket in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, in September 2009.\"The satellites that we put up in space, its cool stuff, but its not necessarily the end goal; the end goal for Astrofica is to deal with the challenges and problems that we would like to solve,\" he says. \"They cannot be solved using purely terrestrial systems, they need these critical space-based insights.\"Manjoo says African countries are spending too much money acquiring agricultural data from international providers, which is not timely enough — although the company welcomes collaboration with foreign partners.According to Manjoo, ride shares — where satellite manufacturers can buy a spot on someone elses rocket — have made getting to space cheaper and more accessible. Astrofica is looking to launch its first satellite on board an American SpaceX rocket, a Russian Soyuz rocket , or a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in India.Launching constellationsSpace in Africa estimates over 283 companies now operate in the continents space and satellite industry, which it says generated more than $7.3 billion in revenue in 2019 and predicts will generate over $10 billion by 2024.Another South African company, Dragonfly Aerospace, provides imaging systems for satellites and is now working on launching its own constellation.\"The new space industry has a lot of opportunity because theres a lot of growth,\" says Bryan Dean, Dragonfly Aerospaces CEO. \"You are now able to launch more satellites for the same amount of money than you were in the past, and a system of satellites in orbit is far more powerful than a single satellite because they work together and combine the data.\"Space entrepreneur Max Polyakov bought the company in April and as part of expansion plans, Dean says Dragonfly Aerospace is near completing a 3,000 square meter satellite manufacturing facility in Stellenbosch, South Africa, with capacity to build up to 48 satellites per year.Dragonfly Aerospaces new facility.Dean says one bottleneck for the production of satellites is being able to test how they will behave in the extreme temperatures of space. \"In the past this was dominated by government facilities which you could rent,\" he says. \"But with the advent of more commercial operations, many companies are investing in having those facilities in house.\"The company hopes to launch its first satellite in June next year from the US.Overcoming roadblocksMinoo Rathnasabapathy, a space research engineer at MIT, says the continents space industry still has challenges to overcome, most notably a lack of resources.\"When you consider the US or Europe, its really apples and oranges.\" she says. \"In the US we see a lot of private industry and a lot of private funding and were seeing NASA and ESA [the European Space Agency] be able to tap into that funding. Whereas in Africa, were just not there yet and thats completely understandable given other priorities of the countries.\"Astroficas Manjoo says another hurdle is changing mindsets.Astroficas Jessie Ndaba and Khalid Manjoo testing SumbandilaSat, a South African micro earth observation satellite, in 2009.\"There is still a view across the continent, quite a myopic view, that the investments that you need to justify in space are too high risk and also that money may be better positioned in terms of alleviating tangible issues such as education, poverty, infrastructure upliftment, which decision makers can see,\" he says.Manjoo adds that government bureaucracy is holding back the African space industry and investment is needed to support local businesses.\"Those are huge amounts of investments,\" he says. \"But countries are slowly starting to understand that the investment in space today is actually for the sustainability and prosperity of your country and your region in the years to come.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/21/business/african-satellites-spc-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "Why are coups making a comeback in Africa?", "data_published": "2021-09-12T12:14:45Z", "content": "(CNN) In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president.These power grabs threaten a reversal of the democratization process Africa has undergone in the past two decades and a return to the era of coups as the norm.Different decade, same problemsIn the early postcolonial decades when coups were rampant, Africas coup leaders virtually always offered the same reasons for toppling governments: corruption, mismanagement, poverty.The leader of Guineas recent coup , Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, echoed these justifications, citing \"poverty and endemic corruption\" as reasons for overthrowing 83 year old president Alpha Conde. The soldiers who led a coup in neighbouring Mali last year claimed \"theft\" and \" bad governance \" prompted their actions. Likewise, the Sudanese and Zimbabwean generals who toppled Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and Robert Mugabe in 2017 respectively, deployed similar arguments.While well-worn, these justifications still resonate with many Africans today for the simple reason they continue to accurately depict the reality of their countries. Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening.The research network Afrobarometer conducted surveys across 19 African countries which showed 6 in 10 respondents saying corruption is increasing in their country (the figure was 63% in Guinea) while 2 in 3 say their governments are doing a poor job fighting it.Furthermore, 72% believe ordinary citizens \"risk retaliation or other negative consequences\" if they report corruption to authorities, a sign Africans believe their public institutions are not just partakers in, but active defenders of, corrupt systems.When it comes to poverty, an already tragic situation has been worsened by the battering Africas fragile economies took from the coronavirus pandemic.This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. \"The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action... and Im not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,\" he says.Threat to democratic gainsWhat is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want.Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure \"MPs reflect voters views\" and to \"enable voters remove non-performing leaders.\"In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies.Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent , from Ugandas Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte dIvoire.The African Union is rightly condemning Guineas coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted.These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day.It is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new.We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred.Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africas most populous country.This increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation.Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves.They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in todays African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/12/africa/africa-coups-resurgence-intl-cmd/index.html"}, {"title": "Nigerian hitmaker Olamide is quietly building a music empire", "data_published": "2021-09-21T12:23:48Z", "content": "(CNN) Unless you are listening to one of the nine albums hes released since 2011, you wont hear much from Olamide.

Upon closer inspection, you see these dramatic images are the culmination of thousands of tiny lines made using a simple ballpoint pen.Suowari, 31, has been an artist since she was a child, practicing professionally for over a decade. She studied Fine Art at the University of Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria, and has participated in group exhibitions globally and had solo exhibitions in Miami and Nigeria.Her work has been featured in several publications including Chukwuemeka Ben Bosahs book, \"The Art of Nigerian Women,\" which celebrates female artists from the Nigerian diaspora.This June she launched a touring exhibition of her new body of work entitled \"Now I Wear Myself.\" In her new exhibition, Suowari considers the fetishization and condemnation of aesthetics associated with indigenous Nigerian cultures, and tries to destigmatize subjects that are often taboo in the country, like depression, grief and shame.Philosophy with a ballpoint penAs a child Suowari didnt know whether to be an artist, a poet or a dancer -- so she decided to be all three. \"Somehow, Ive been able to merge all these things together to form the Jacqueline Suowari experience,\" she laughed.\"I describe myself as a visual artist who specializes primarily with the ballpoint pen,\" said Suowari. Her practice is a combination of intricate drawings paired with bold Afro-urban painted elements in poppy, primary colors. These works -- often up to eight feet tall -- are accompanied by poetry and performance art.\"With my drawings, I have this philosophy of layering -- its just a way that I pattern my strokes upon each other,\" explained Suowari. \"I like to look at each stroke as the human experience. One experience, one stroke -- and the gathering, and layering, and falling together of all the strokes creates the person and their character.\"Suowari works in fine detail on a macro scale.

And with a growing middle class, it has become a target for an increasing number of companies and multinationals looking to grow their profits.But marketing products to this vast consumer base is tricky, and the rapid growth of mobile phone adoption across the continent means international advertising giants like Ogilvy have had to develop new strategies.CNNs Cyril Vanier spoke with Ogilvy South Africas Group CEO, Enver Groenewald, about the agencys role on the continent, and how and where advertising dollars will be seen in the future.The following interview was edited and condensed for clarity.Cyril Vanier: When it started in Africa, the company played a significant role in boosting South Africas economy and South African companies. Can you talk to us about that?Enver Groenewald: The 1990s was a period in which we established a quite significant growth. After the 1994 elections there was a lot of pessimism and negativity towards democracy coming to the fore in South Africa, particularly. And off the back of that, I think that Ogilvy really introduced a type of advertising genre that spoke to social justice, that spoke to social unity, that spoke to really celebrating the best of a democratic South Africa.Enver Groenewald, Ogilvys South Africa Group CEO.CV: Can you give us examples of something that would have been important in terms of Ogilvys work specific to South Africas history?EG: One of the most seminal examples is the work done for VW ... where we told the story of management and employees coming together at a time in which there were great industrial relations tensions. At the time, that was unheard of because trade unions were in opposition to business owners and management. This piece of work for VW was surprising in telling the story of how for the success, not only of the company, but the workers in that company and the communities that depended on the success of that company, could come together.The other was for Castle, which still remains one of the most successful beer brands in South Africa, and really positioned itself on the notion of social cohesion and the coming together of groups that up until then had been separated by Apartheid. It celebrated the very best of what I think both the Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela promoted: this idea of a rainbow nation. That we were a country made up of very different colors, but put together, it made for a beautiful sight.CV: Can you talk about the talent in your sector in South Africa and more widely on the African continent. How does that compare to other regions?EG: We have an amazing wealth of talent across our continent. I dont think that talent in Africa, particularly from an advertising industry perspective, has to stand back for any other region. Some people may have that perspective that if the advertising doesnt come from a North American perspective or Western Europe perspective, its not that great because those territories and regions are the benchmark. I reject that completely. When you look at advertising, communication, creativity through the lens of authenticity, then that levels the playing field.A mural of advertising agency founder David Ogilvy at the companys offices in Johannesburg.Im talking about African creative talent not trying to emulate any other region but remaining authentic and true to what is intimately African. And I just want to qualify what I mean when I say typically Africa, because Africa is not one country. If youre a creative in Lagos versus a creative in Accra or a creative in Cape Town, youve got very different perspectives and very different definitions of authenticity.CV: What does it mean for Ogilvy to be a more than 50% Black-owned company?EG: It is probably one of the most important things that characterizes Ogilvy in the context, not only of the advertising industry in South Africa, but in the context of South Africa as a country and in terms of redressing the imbalances of the past. Being 51% Black-owned is vital in terms of making sure that we are contributing to economic transformation where its needed most.CV: What do you want Ogilvy to accomplish in the next five to 10 years?EG: I want Ogilvy to be a force for social change in South Africa. I go back to the idea of us not seeing brands and the power of brands only through the lens of the transactional relationship between the consumer and the product. I think brands can play an eminently powerful role in creating social cohesion and social justice.

For the tiny island nation of Mauritius, it was an opportunity to lure prospective international investors to its shores.Located off the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, the island -- which recently reopened to vaccinated tourists -- is known for its temperate tropical weather, pristine beaches and azure waters.According to Ken Poonoosamy, CEO of the Mauritius Economic Development Board, the island has been courting international homebuyers since the early 2000s, when the country launched its Integrated Resort Scheme -- which paved the way for foreign investors to legally purchase property and land on the island.For the past decade, Mauritius has been focused on growing its real estate industry.

Its involuntary and unique to the individual, with an estimated 2-4% of the population experiencing some kind of synesthesia.As a result, Gyasi has his own internal color code that creates layered narratives within his work. \"If Im doing a project on hope, I already know I see hope as pink, so I think about how to push this color into the work for it to make sense,\" he said.\"Its not about the tool, its your mind.

Lack of education and opportunities leave children here stuck in a cycle of poverty, said Gyasi, who knows the struggle first-hand: his mother, Abena Serwaa Ophelia , was born in Jamestown, and dropped out of school at a young age, before finding success as a gospel singer and fashion designer.\"I feel Im one of the lucky ones, because I could have been on the streets like most of the kids in Jamestown,\" said Gyasi. \"Im very privileged that my mom actually knew how to work with her talent (for singing) and made sure I made it to school.\"Now, Gyasi is determined to help others break the cycle, too.

Here's why", "data_published": "2021-09-14T08:08:11Z", "content": "Nairobi (CNN Business) While passenger air travel has plummeted during the pandemic, demand for air cargo has surged. With e-commerce up and trucks often unable to cross borders, air freight became a global lifeline transporting medical supplies and personal protective equipment, as well as all kinds of everyday products.According to the International Air Transport Association, in June this year African airlines increased freight volumes by 33.5% compared to the same period in 2019 — a bigger increase than anywhere else in the world.CNN Business spoke with Allan Kilavuka, group managing director and CEO at Kenya Airways, from inside what he calls \" the worlds first cargo-converted Dreamliner 787 ,\" about how the airline has pivoted to meet this market shift. The following interview has been edited for clarity and length.How did Covid-19 impact your business?Kilavuka: Kenya Airways is one of the largest operators within Africa. Last year, like all other airlines, we suffered a significant drop in numbers. Before 2020, we were flying approximately 5 million passengers per year, 2019 being the record year. In 2020, which was the year that we suffered the pandemic, it dropped to about 1.8 million. So a significant drop and those numbers are reflected in our revenue numbers and subsequently our losses.We also used to fly to 53 destinations across the world — that dropped to 41 but we hope to scale it back up a little bit more. Within Africa, we used to fly to over 40 destinations. That again has dropped to currently 36 destinations. Some we need to reactivate and see how that grows going forward.The inside of Kenya Airways cargo-converted Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi, Kenya, on July 6.How has the airline responded to the growing demand for air cargo?Kilavuka: Until now cargo has been about 10% of our business. We want to grow that to over 20% of our business, to double it within the next three to five years. And in order to do that, we need to increase capacity.So right now we are sitting in the worlds first cargo converted Dreamliner 787. This one we have dedicated to cargo — this and another one like this. We have at least 50 tons of cargo in this one \"preighter\" [a passenger plane converted to carry freight] that helps transport mainly horticulture products to Europe, meat to the EU, crabs to China and so on. And then of course, to import certain items from Europe and Asia to Africa.So cargo is extremely important in our strategic framework because of the role it will play in the bigger Kenya Airways business endeavors. Why? Because first of all, we think this is a good revenue stream for us. Secondly, it diversifies our portfolio a little bit more, so it safeguards our business. Thirdly, it supports businesses within Africa, which is what were about. Were about sustainable development within Africa. So we want to play our part in helping and supporting businesses to export their products.According to the African Airlines Association, domestic travel provided up to 61.5% of passenger flights for African airlines during the pandemic. How much of your focus is on boosting Africa and intra-Africa connectivity?Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka.Kilavuka: 60% of our traffic is within Africa. And we intend to continuously grow that because we are predominantly an African airline and thats how we want to position ourselves, because we believe theres a lot of potential on the continent. So there are several phases that we will undertake. First of all, its to reinstate our original network. The ambition is to then expand into secondary cities, because we fly to most primary cities, to most capital cities. Now its to look at players that will help us to go into secondary cities that make sense for the business.Also, looking for opportunities for \"fifth freedom flights\" [flying between two foreign countries] ... so that we can collect more traffic. This we can do either directly or through partnerships.Aside from cargo, how has the pandemic reshaped your business model?Kilavuka: Covid-19 has completely changed the way we look at things. The customer is demanding different things now. They are more concerned about health and hygiene, so were taking extra measures to make them feel comfortable when it comes to that aspect of the business.Secondly, they want a more flexible booking process and thats what weve done as well. They want more digital space and so on and so forth. So really, were looking at the customer more and tailoring our product to match their needs.There are also other revenue streams. Weve launched a drone initiative. Were working very hard at it. We think we have a very strong value proposition, especially because we have a lot of experience. We have over 44 years of experience in manned aircraft — we want to transfer that experience from manned aircraft to unmanned aircraft and offer a very valuable service to operators, not just within Kenya, but outside Kenya.We want to do a lot of surveillance, surveillance support, inspections and even light cargo deliveries. So we are working on commercializing this unit. We think that in five years time, it will be a significant portion of our business.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/14/business/kenya-airways-ceo-cargo-converted-787-dreamliner-spc-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "Can a motorcycle-hailing company create an African super app?", "data_published": "2021-07-21T07:57:18Z", "content": "(CNN Business) Super apps have taken off in Asia, with users able to book flights, reserve hotels, play games and more all in one place.But theyve yet to make their mark in Africa.

According to the company, the first section of this line will be operational in 2023.Siemens, which is partnering on the project with Orascom Construction S.A.E. and The Arab Contractors, says the total contract is worth around $4.5 billion, of which its share is approximately $3 billion.A Suez Canal on tracksEgypts population is over 100 million , having more than doubled since 1980. Cairo, with a population of around 20 million, is sprawling into the surrounding desert.To cater to that growth, the fast train fits within a wider set of infrastructure spending in Egypt, including its new capital 30 miles east of Cairo.A rendering of the future high-speed train in Egypt.

They store and process vast amounts of data in the blink of an eye, translate language instantaneously, and even operate machinery. But they have the same emotional intelligence as a brick wall.Egyptian-American computer scientist Rana el Kaliouby wants to change that.The 43-year-old co-founded her company Affectiva while undertaking a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Specializing in \"Emotion AI,\" a subsect of artificial intelligence, Kaliouby wants to teach computers how to recognize and quantify human emotions.Technology has created an \"empathy crisis,\" Kaliouby says -- and her mission is to humanize it.Teaching computers to feelOne of the early applications of Emotion AI that Kaliouby explored was tech-enabled glasses to help children with autism read facial expressions. The glasses offered prompts to the wearer, telling them how to respond to various non-verbal cues like smiling or frowning. \"We started to see a lot of really positive improvements in these kids; it was just really powerful,\" says Kaliouby. After years of research and development, the technology was officially launched in 2017 for integration into smart glasses such as Google Glass.Technology has always been a part of Kalioubys life. Born in Egypt, her parents were both computer programmers, and she studied computer science at the American University in Cairo before co-founding Affectiva in 2009 with Rosalind Picard.The company has grown from a university spin-out into an international, multi-million dollar enterprise with headquarters in Boston. But Kaliouby maintains close ties with Egypt, and Affectiva employs about 60 people at its Cairo office, including software engineers and machine learning scientists.Affectivas emotion-reading AI software is being applied to driver monitoring systems, to detect drowsiness.Life-saving techOne area where Kaliouby believes Emotion AI could have life-saving applications is the automotive industry, where driver monitoring systems that use AI-powered cameras in cars could potentially detect driver distraction and drowsiness, preventing accidents.In May 2021, Affectiva was acquired by Smart Eye, a leader in eye-tracking technology for driver monitoring, and the two companies are now combining their technologies.According to the European Commission , 90% of road accidents are down to human error -- one reason the EU has introduced new regulations for all European vehicles to include this kind of technology by 2022, and legislation is being considered in the US. Car manufacturers such as Tesla and General Motors have incorporated driver monitoring tech into some of their vehicles, and Affectiva is already working with big automotive brands including BMW, Porsche and Hyundai.There are other applications for cars too, says Kaliouby, including cameras that can view the full cabin to customize the driving experience. \"If my baby in the backseat is falling asleep, it can dim the lights, or stop the music; it could change the temperature,\" she says. \"You can personalize the car based on whos in it, what theyre doing, and how theyre feeling.\"Co-founded by Rana el Kaliouby (pictured) and Rosalind Picard, Affectiva has offices in Boston, US, and Cairo, Egypt.Surveillance or safety?But using Emotion AI to monitor people can be controversial. Racial and gender bias is a recurring issue, along with privacy concerns. This year, Brazilian metro operator ViaQuatro was fined 100,000 Brazilian reals ($20,000) for capturing facial recognition data without users consent. ViaQuatro had installed an emotion-detecting camera system on the São Paulo Metro in 2018 to monitor peoples reactions to advertisements. The company claims the system did not carry out facial recognition, and complied with data protection legislation.Even theoretically \"positive\" uses could have more sinister consequences, says Vidushi Marda, an AI researcher , policy advisor and lawyer at Article 19, a human rights organization that defends freedom of expression. For example, driver monitoring systems could double as workplace surveillance for truck or taxi drivers, she says, adding that regardless of the intended use, Emotion AI is \"surveillance enabling.\" Marda says there is \"no easy way to mitigate\" the harmful uses of Emotion AI.Some scientists even dispute the effectiveness of using AI to read emotions. A 2019 meta-study of more than 1,000 research papers found insufficient evidence to support the concept of \"universal facial expressions,\" and according to a 2020 study , emotion-recognition AI can be less accurate than humans.Aware of the many concerns surrounding Emotion AI, Kaliouby says Affectiva has a strict opt-in policy for data collection and transparency around how data is being used and stored.\"Anywhere where peoples data privacy considerations are not respected, were not going to do,\" says Kaliouby, adding that the company turns down those wanting to use the software for surveillance, security or lie detection.With 11 million facial responses from 90 countries around the world, Kaliouby says Affectiva is trying to create a diverse database that removes age, gender and racial biases from its system. Affectiva is working on a model which includes facial expression and tone of voice, and accounts for nuances such as culture and context.In the years to come, Kaliouby hopes Emotion AI can help create a more human, empathetic digital experience.\"The mission is to transform what a human-machine interface looks like, because thats not going to just improve our interactions with technology, but its going to make our own connections with each other in a digital world so much better,\" she says.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/01/world/rana-el-kaliouby-affectiva-emotion-ai-hnk-spc-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "La Niña has arrived and will stick around.

This could mean the drought-stricken Southwest will likely stay dry . (La Niña also was present last winter and worsened the drought situation across the West and Southwest.)The Southeast is also typically drier during a La Niña winter, though before the season starts, it increases the possibility for tropical weather, including hurricanes.La Niña will persist through winter in the USLa Niña -- translated from Spanish as \"little girl\"-- is a natural ocean-atmospheric phenomenon marked by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean near the equator that consequently impact weather across the world.\"La Niña is anticipated to affect temperature and precipitation across the United States during the upcoming months,\" the center said as it issued a La Niña advisory Thursday, predicting conditions are present and expected to remain.The advisory replaces the La Niña Watch, which indicated favorable conditions for development that had been in place since July.NOAA will release its winter outlook October 21, and the presence of La Niña is expected to weigh heavily in the forecast for the season. The prediction center put the odds near 90% that La Niña would be in place through the winter of 2021-2022.Both La Niña and El Niño occur every three to five years on average, according to NOAA.La Niñas impact on the rest of hurricane seasonDuring La Niña, weaker winds between the ocean surface and upper levels of the atmosphere impact global jet streams and can influence the track and severity of winter storms and hurricanes during warmer months.\"La Nina is associated with reductions in vertical wind shear in the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic,\" said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University. \"Too much shear is typically what ends the Atlantic hurricane season, so La Niña can extend the active part of the season.\"Last year is a great example of this, as we had six hurricanes and five major hurricanes in October-November,\" he said. \"While we certainly dont expect to see that much activity the remainder of this season, the development of La Niña does leave the window open for more late-season storm activity this year.\"At the start of this hurricane season, seasonal forecasters said to look out for La Niña forming in October because it could make the second half of the season active.Currently, conditions across most of the Atlantic are not conducive for hurricane formation. But this could change in the coming weeksLa Niña and the climate crisisWhile El Niño and La Niña events are regular aspects of global weather patterns, increased global temperatures may temper or change their effects.La Niña tends to pull down global temperatures, but in recent years, the planet has warmed so fast, its like hitting a small speed bump at 80 mph -- it barely even registers.Its likely too early to know how climate change will affect those patterns; research is beginning to show how a warming climate may amplify the effects of El Niño and La Niña. Climate change could increase the severity of weather events stemming from El Niño and La Niña patterns, according to a 2018 study on atmospheric conditions that ran simulations of climate conditions.Top spots on the warmest-years list used to be reserved for the strong El Niño years, but human influences have long since overwhelmed the planets natural temperature regulators. For instance, La Niña was present during parts of 2020, but the year still tied with 2016 (an El Niño year) as the hottest on record for the planet.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/10/14/weather/la-nina-develops-2021/index.html"}, {"title": "18 weather and climate disasters this year have killed over 500 people and cost over $100 billion in US", "data_published": "2021-10-12T15:46:05Z", "content": "Photos: Wildfires raging in the West The Alisal Fire burns near Goleta, California, on Tuesday, October 12.

That number dwindled to about 40 a day in the 2010s.\"The economic cost of Hurricane Ida is still to be fully assessed, as the true extent of the damage becomes apparent,\" WMOs secretary-general Petteri Taalas told CNN. \"But it is clear that the loss of life was kept to a minimum because of all the lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina and the excellent early warning systems.\"In Europe, although storms and flooding were the most prevalent drivers of disasters there, extreme heat accounted for the highest number of deaths — 93% — with nearly 150,000 lives lost over the last 50 years. In Africa, droughts caused the highest number of deaths, accounting for 95% of weather-related deaths in the region.Dozens of people died during a flooding event that destroyed the barrio of San Bernardino in Caracas, Venezuela, in December 1999.While extreme weather events can impact anyone in the world, the report found they strike and impact different countries and groups of people unequally. More than 91% of weather and climate disaster-related deaths occurred in developing countries, for example.\"By contrast, the loss of life from Tropical Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique in 2019, was very high because the forecasts did not give enough indication about the impact of the winds, rain and flooding, and did not reach those who needed them most,\" Taalas added. Cyclone Idai killed more than 1,000 people in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawai in 2019.The financial costs and lost incomes associated with these extreme weather events are also mounting dramatically, accounting for three-quarters of all reported economic losses.\"Its encouraging, certainly, that the number of deaths are going down, but the economics are deeply disturbing,\" said Marlon, who was not involved with the report.According to the report, storms and floods caused the largest economic losses.Photos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas Downtown Houston is seen behind the flooded Buffalo Bayou a few days after Hurricane Harvey came ashore in August 2017.

Hide Caption 22 of 22Six of the top most expensive weather and climate-related disasters around the world happened in the US alone, with three happening all in 2017: Hurricane Harvey in Texas caused $96.9 billion in losses; Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico caused $69.4 billion; and Hurricane Irma , which hit Florida — along with the Caribbean — caused $58.2 billion. Hurricane Katrina, which hit the same area Ida just did, was responsible for the biggest loss.The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has historically borrowed from the Treasury Department to pay claims for disasters. As of August 2020, FEMAs debt had ballooned to $20.5 billion, despite Congress erasing a $16 billion debt from Hurricane Katrina in October 2017 to pay for hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.Climate change has become a major driver to these disasters. According to peer-reviewed studies gathered by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , roughly 80% of extreme weather events reported from 2015 to 2017 showed significant human influence. Nearly every analysis of major heatwaves since 2015 has been attributed in part to human-made climate change, the report said.As the climate crisis accelerates, extreme weather events will become more frequent and severe. While the number of deaths are fewer than 50 years ago, Marlon said more people will still be at risk and more vulnerable to weather and climate-related disasters, unless the planet slashes greenhouse gas emissions and improves emergency preparedness systems\"People need to recognize that these events that happened in the past are no longer a good predictor of the future and that we need to be much more prepared because we are in a different world,\" Marlon said. \"We have more vulnerable people at risk, so we really need to develop a stronger culture of preparedness.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/01/weather/extreme-weather-climate-change-economy/index.html"}, {"title": "'Hotlanta' is even more sweltering in these neighborhoods due to a racist 20th-century policy", "data_published": "2021-09-18T09:09:09Z", "content": "Atlanta (CNN) On a warm September afternoon, Mona Scott sat on the front porch while her home baked like an oven. As she ran a frozen water bottle across her forehead and arms, Scott told CNN her air conditioning broke 10 days earlier and had not yet been fixed.\"The windows are painted shut,\" Scott said. \"We come outside at night to sleep because its too hot inside.\"Like Scott, residents in the low-income communities across south and southwest Atlanta are struggling to cope with the hottest summer since the Dust Bowl period of the 1930s.\"Its just so hot,\" Scott said as she wiped sweat from her brow.Heat waves are the most lethal weather-related disaster in America. And these health risks are not distributed equally . During extreme heat events, a few city blocks can mean the difference between a manageable 80-degree afternoon or a sweltering, 100-degree sweat fest.The staggering temperature difference is due in large part to historical redlining , a federal government-sanctioned effort that began in the 1930s that amplified segregation by denying loans and insurance to potential home buyers in poorer neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color.While the racist practice was banned in the late 1960s, its effect is still apparent.Across Americas largest cities, Black homeowners are nearly five times more likely than White families to own homes in these historically redlined communities , according to a study by Redfin. These communities, like where Scott resides in South Atlanta, endure the greatest burdens of our rapidly warming planet, and now tend to be the hottest and poorest areas.Extreme heat threatens the health and well-being of underserved communities today, while predominantly White neighborhoods reap the cooler benefits of decades of investment.\"I went to get groceries the other day and I thought I was going to pass out.\" Scott told CNN. She said she suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes, which are underlying health conditions made worse by excessive heat.Keeping the lights on is hard enough financially for Scott, and so many other disadvantaged community members, let alone having access to reliable air conditioning.Confronting environmental racismSome cities, like New Orleans and New York, suffer from the worst urban heat in the nation, according to a recent study by Climate Central. Atlanta, affectionately known as \"Hotlanta,\" is also particularly hot.Spelman College, a historically Black college in Atlanta, partnered with a NOAA campaign and other universities to map the hottest and most vulnerable communities. Spelmans involvement is significant because it is the first time a historically Black college or university has led an initiative such as this, NaTaki Osborne Jelks, assistant professor of environmental and health sciences at Spelman College told CNN.\"As we think about global challenges like climate change, this is one of the issues that disproportionately impacts Black and other communities of color,\" Jelks said. \"So, its very important that we are at the table.\"NaTaki Osborne Jelks, assistant professor of environmental and health sciences at Spelman College, discusses Spelmans role in NOAAs Urban Heat Island campaign on September 4, 2021.Black people are 40% more likely to live in areas with the largest projected increase in heat-related deaths if the planet reaches 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, according to a recent EPA report . This rises to 59% if the planet reaches 4 degrees Celsius.In August , global scientists said warming had already reached approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius and showed no signs of slowing.People like Scott are the reason that NOAAs National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) campaign has been mapping Americas urban heat islands since 2017. This community-led, multi-city program has helped city planners identify and map the hottest neighborhoods of American cities.The urban heat island effect occurs when a citys unshaded pavement and buildings absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate that heat into the surrounding air. This can make even average summer days feel unbearable in dense urban environments, especially to those without access to reliable cooling like Scott.Jelks and Guanyu Huang, an assistant professor of environmental and health sciences at Spelman College and the local leader of Atlantas heat mapping campaign, are both very passionate about this work. They are hopeful that the data will result in changes in the city in which they both reside.\"So, this data will actually help people in Atlanta, especially in the downtown area or intercity area, the people who are actually suffering from heat and also dont have access to an AC system,\" Huang said.Guanyu Huang is an assistant professor of environmental and health sciences at Spelman College in Atlanta. Huang coordinated and led the Atlanta portion of NOAAs Urban Heat Island campaign on September 4, 2021.Other cities that have been part of the NOAA heat-mapping campaign have taken the results and made changes, such as planting more trees or adding more parks to areas that are suffering from the worst heat.The inequities in green space is striking as you traverse Atlanta. Driving through Scotts neighborhood there are fewer and smaller parks than nearby neighborhoods that are predominantly White, and natural shade from trees is also lacking.Despite being called \"a city in the forest,\" where trees are abundant across much of the Atlanta metro, heat inequality remains.This study is personalBrionna Findley, a former Atlanta resident and a volunteer for the urban heat island campaign, has experience with the inequity. She has witnessed firsthand her communitys lack of access to air conditioning and shaded green space.Brionna Findley, a volunteer for NOAAs Urban Heat Island campaign, discusses why this campaign is personal to her and her family.Findley says she and her family endured countless heat waves in Atlanta when they were there. And it seems to only be getting hotter.\"When I was taking a temperature reading for that specific day, we had higher temperatures when it came to low-tree-cover areas, with more infrastructure and more asphalt on the road,\" Findley said. \"It was extremely hot, you can feel it. It wasnt something that was hidden. Like, you felt the temperatures.\"This campaign is personal for Findley after her own grandmother experienced signs of heatstroke.\"It was like one of the hottest days in Georgia. And we went out and we were out walking around the shopping mall center, and we had to go home because you could see, like one side of her face was going down,\" Findley explained. \"She was having slurred speech. That was very, it was very hard to see that. I was very scared.\"\"Shes OK. But we definitely dont let her go outside that much, especially when its hot out there,\" Findley said. \"Like, Grandma, you need to stay inside today and do some inside activities.\"It could get worseIn general, temperatures across much of the contiguous United States are warming and city environments are experiencing the brunt of the heat due to these urban heat islands. The warming trend is apparent in a new NOAA analysis of average weather.Annual US temperature compared to the 20th-century average for each U.S. Climate Normals period from 1901-1930 (upper left) to 1991-2020 (lower right). Places where the normal annual temperature was 1.25 degrees or more colder than the 20th-century average are darkest blue; places where normal annual temperature was 1.25 degrees or more warmer than the 20th-century average are darkest red. Maps by NOAA Climate.gov, based on analysis by Jared Rennie, North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies/NCEI.In Atlanta, the city now averages 11 more 90-degree, or hotter, days in the summer, compared to the old 30-year average. Salt Lake City averages 10 more days at 90 degrees or above, and Houston gained nine days.Once the urban heat islands are mapped, city planners will have more tools to combat environmental inequalities , which experts say will only be exacerbated by the climate crisis.\"If we combine all the data from all the cities together, it will be helpful for all levels of government from state level, federal level to create some climate resilience plan for the entire country. So, thats what we can do through here,\" Huang said. \"We can use it to do research, to teach your climate change classes, to tell the people that climate change is actually right there, its just next to our neighborhood.\"Potential solutions for a better futureCity planners from Houston used the data from the campaigns 2020 analysis to enact a Climate Action Plan designed to help build resilience against climate disasters, including extreme heat.Richmond , Virginia, is utilizing the information to transform city-owned land into public green space, providing cooling options to those in need.\"I used to live in New York, and they had cooling centers where people that was homeless could come in in the daytime to keep from being out in the heat, drink water, maybe get a sandwich and a snack. And I aint never seen that down here (in Atlanta),\" Scott said. \"I think they (city planners) should plant trees in hot areas, especially around bus stops. I think they need to open up some kind of center, you know, to help keep people cool.\"While Atlanta has had cooling centers available during extreme heat waves, in the past these centers were not open overnight, when high temperatures can have a particularly severe health impact . The City of Atlanta did not respond to a request for comment about cooling center availability.Covid-19 has also made unofficial cooling centers, like libraries or malls, harder to access, while they may have been more available to the general public before the pandemic. In some cases, Scott has found these locations are simply closed.Jelks said that these communities need investments and solutions in a way that doesnt end up displacing them.\"We can add new trees, but weve got to make sure that there are also policy supports to keep the people who are currently suffering from the lack of access to these amenities,\" Jelks said. \"We want to keep them in place and make sure that they are not displaced by gentrification and moved out of their communities.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/18/weather/extreme-urban-heat-environmental-racism-climate/index.html"}, {"title": "Antarctica's last 6 months were the coldest on record", "data_published": "2021-10-09T09:01:42Z", "content": "(CNN) In a year of extreme heat, Antarcticas last six months were the coldest on record.\"For the polar darkness period, from April through September, the average temperature was -60.9 degrees Celsius (-77.6 degrees Fahrenheit), a record for those months,\" the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) said.The last six months is also the darkest period at the South Pole, which is where the name polar darkness (also called polar night) comes from. Here, the sun sets for the last time around the spring equinox, and does not rise again until near the autumn equinox six months later.For the entire Antarctic continent, the winter of 2021 was the second-coldest on record, with the \"temperature for June, July, and August 3.4 degrees Celsius (6.1 degrees Fahrenheit) lower than the 1981 to 2010 average at -62.9 degrees Celsius (-81.2 degrees Fahrenheit),\" according to a new report from the NSIDC.\"This is the second-coldest winter (June-July-August months) on record, behind only 2004 in the 60-year weather record at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station,\" the NSIDC said.Even in a warming world (climate change), there are areas of below average temperatures and record cold.However, record highs will increasingly outpace the cold.Here is an example of the large day-to-day temperature changes (weather) around the world: https://t.co/6VXvqV9a5T — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) February 10, 2021\"The unusual cold was attributed to two extended periods of stronger-than-average encircling winds around the continent, which tend to isolate the ice sheet from warmer conditions,\" the NSIDC explained. \"A strong upper-atmosphere polar vortex was observed as well, leading to a significant ozone hole. The ozone hole appears to have peaked as of this post, with initial measurements reporting that it is in the upper quartile (top 25 percent) of ozone reduction events since 1979.\"Even in the austral summer months of November through February, it never really gets \"warm\" at the South Pole. The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which sits at an elevation of 2,835 meters (9,300 feet), has an average monthly temperature in the austral summer of -28°C (-18°F).The National Science Foundation, which runs the US Antarctic program, points out the winter temperatures have had minimal impact in science support from the South Pole, since most of the deep fieldwork occurs in the austral summer. However, the polar environments are still challenging.\"Everyone adapts to the cold differently, and todays gear makes it much safer than in the days when Shackleton and the other explorers had little specialized gear; they had only wool socks and leather shoes to protect their feet!\" a NSF spokesperson said. \"All of NSFs US Antarctic Program (USAP) participants are given extreme cold weather gear and are trained in how to recognize the dangers of extreme cold.\"One extremely cold winter is intriguing from a record keeping standpoint, but one season alone does not change the long-term progression, which is rapid warming.Weather versus climateIt is important to understand weather is different from climate. Weather is what happens over shorter periods of time (days to months), such as the seven-day forecast. Climate is what happens over much longer periods of time, such as several years, or even entire generations.\"One such example is a cold snap, which can happen due to sudden changes in atmospheric circulation and may not be linked to climate change,\" says Tom Slater, Research Fellow at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds. \"Texas is a good example of this; even though parts of it experienced extreme cold weather earlier this year when air from the Arctic was pushed south, looking at the long-term change in temperature tells us that Texas is 1.5 degrees warmer on average now than it was 100 years ago. Thats climate.\"Scientists also agree that since the 1950s extreme cold snaps do occur, but climate change is bringing far more heat records than cold records.\"In other words, while the globe may be warmer than average as a whole, some areas will still observe colder temperatures and even severe cold outbreaks,\" says Zack Labe, Climate Scientist at Colorado State University. \"This regional variation is due to the influences of the oceans, mountains, deserts, ice sheets, and other geographic features that all affect our weather and climate. Its also from changes in weather patterns that are related to the position of the jet stream (storm track), which can vary from day-to-day or even month-to-month.\"So, this recent winter stretch from June-August is definitely interesting from a research standpoint, but it doesnt necessarily reflect what Antarctica is doing in the long term.One great example of this is while June-August of this year may have been quite cold, February of the previous year recorded the new all-time record high for the Antarctic continent. On February 6, 2020, the Esperanza Research Station recorded a high temperature of 18.3°C degrees (64.9°F). This broke the previous record for the Antarctic region (continental, including mainland and surrounding islands) of 17.5°C (63.5°F) recorded in March 2015 at the same station.\"There were thousands upon thousands of these penguins just in distress because they were so overheated and there was no snow,\" Camille Seaman, a photographer who has traveled to Antarctica, told CNN in August \"They were looking for any little patch of snow or ice to lay on.\"Polar oppositesWhat is happening at one pole, does not mean it is happening at the other.Thanks to the extreme cold near the South Pole, Antarctic sea ice extent has been above average the last few months, peaking in late August when it reached the 5th highest in the satellite record.Antarctic sea ice extent has been above average for the past several months, culminating in late August when extent was the 5th highest in the satellite record.

Although Antarctica has had a cold winter this year, over the past few decades the most northerly parts of Antarctica have warmed five times faster than the global average -- thats faster than anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere.\"While scientists take note of the changes occurring at Earths poles, the bigger danger lies in the more populated continents where people live and work.\"As a climate scientist, I am particularly alarmed at how extreme heatwaves, such as the one which impacted the Pacific Northwest this summer, are projected to become more common in the future,\" Labe said. \"But right now we have a big opportunity.

But the G7 leaders meeting in June and a G20 ministers meeting last month left some on the global stage disappointed and unsure of what can be accomplished in November.The G20 communiqué was delivered more than a day later than expected, as some countries opposed language on the issues of when to phase out coal and around the commitment to 1.5 degrees, according to Roberto Cingolani, Italys ecological transition minister, who chaired the meeting.Cingolani told reporters after the conference India and China were holding out on the issue of coal.A source familiar with the talks at the time told CNN that the significant resistance was coming from fossil fuel producing countries, including some developing economies.At a press conference on Monday, Sharma denied that the 1.5-degree threshold was still divisive, and pointed to the communiqué G20 ministers ultimately agreed to, in which counties said they would \"continue efforts\" to limit it to 1.5 above pre-industrial levels.Flames consume a home as firefighters attempt to stop the spread of the Dixie fire in Greenville, California on August 4. The IPCC says it is unequivocal that humans are causing climate change.\"Based on all the conversations that Ive had, I can tell you that there is a clear desire amongst governments to keep that 1.5 degrees within reach,\" Sharma said.Yet Chinas top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua last week accused some countries of trying to shift the goal posts from 2 degrees, which countries agreed to in the Paris Accord, to 1.5 degrees.\"Some countries are pushing to rewrite the Paris Agreement,\" Xie said, according to the AFP news agency. \"That is, they want to strive to change the target of control for the rise of temperature from two degrees Celsius to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\"He added, \"We have to understand the different situations in different countries, and strive to reach a consensus.\"And while the G20 ministers eventually agreed to language around 1.5 degrees, some did so begrudgingly. India published its own statement alongside the communiqué defending developing nations need to grow, urging richer countries to bring their emissions down faster.Consigning coal to historyThe G7 and G20 often try to show leadership in global policy areas -- together, they represent represent 80% of the worlds emissions and around 85% of the global economy. But the G20 meeting also failed to reach a concrete agreement on coal phaseout and the scrapping of fossil fuel subsidies.Windmills in Lauterstein, Germany. Replacing coal-gereated energy with renewables will be a key topic at COP26 in Glasgow this year.Only 13 members of the G20 have committed to net zero, Sharma pointed out Monday, and only eight have submitted new pledges that go beyond their previous ones. All signatories to the Paris Agreement were supposed to submit a second, more ambitious pledge by July this year.Sharma said the failure to reach an agreement on coal was \"disappointing\" and admitted that securing one ahead of the COP26 conference will be tricky. He wants the worlds richest countries to scrap coal by 2030 and the rest of the world by 2040.Coal will be on the docket again at the next G20, which comes just before the COP26 summit.$100 billion a year for the developing worldAnother sticking point for developing nations is that they havent received the money they were promised to adapt to climate change.The developed world in 2009 agreed to transfer $100 billion every year to the developing world by 2020. That commitment was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement but the goal was never met. Old divisions and distrust have resurfaced as a result.A net zero economy powered on renewable energy involves overhauling infrastructure, employing new technologies, transitioning to electric vehicles and rethinking jobs and entire industries. Developing nations argue that many of the worlds richest countries became wealthy because they were free to exploit the very fossil fuels they now want the rest of the world to phase out.Withholding promised funds could mean that some countries are less likely budge on on scrapping coal and committing to 1.5 degrees.Whats at stake?Already at 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the world is heading for average global temperatures of 1.5 degrees faster than scientists thought, the IPCC report said. That threshold will likely be crossed in the mid-2030s, even if greenhouse gas is reduced sharply starting today.The good news is we can keep it to 1.5 and avoid hitting 2 degrees, after which the impacts of climate change will become even more severe, according to the report.\"The key thing to focus on is that every degree of warming, that every tenth of a degree of warming, matters,\" Tamsin Edwards, a climate scientist at Kings College London and one of the authors of the new IPCC report, told CNN. \"Its getting harder and harder every year to limit warming to 1.5 degrees because it means we have to cut emissions faster to get to net zero.\"\"The reductions in emissions have to be immediate, rapid and large scale,\" she added.If by the 2050s the world achieves net zero -- where the net addition and removal of greenhouse gas is zero -- it can contain temperature rises to 1.5 degrees.The other good news is that the science shows that climate systems would respond well to carbon removal. Planting more trees, expanding carbon sinks and possibly using technology that still being developed will limit the warming and its catastrophic consequences.Coastal areas like Monpura in Bhola, Bangladesh are on the front line of climate change.But so much has already been lost. Many of the effects of climate change are now \"baked in\" and impossible to reverse in the short term, like ice sheet and glacier melt that will cause sea level rises.The question now is whether leaders will meet the moment and prevent the level of warming that will lead to catastrophe. Its also a question of whether politicians will learn from mistakes of the past.\"Youve been telling us for over three decades of the dangers of allowing the planet to warm,\" UN Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said to scientists Monday, after the IPCC report launched.\"The world listened, but it didnt hear. The world listened, but it didnt act strongly enough. As a result, climate change is a problem that is here, now. Nobodys safe, and its getting worse faster.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/08/10/world/climate-ipcc-report-cop26-politics-cmd-intl/index.html"}, {"title": "First significant snowstorm of the season takes aim at the Rockies", "data_published": "2021-10-11T16:27:57Z", "content": "CNN Weather produces a weekly column, publishing Mondays with the weather news you should be aware of and the weeks hurricane outlook.

I know the average for Denver is October 18 for the first snowfall and it definitely varies depending on where you are in the mountain,\" said NWS Boulder meteorologist Caitlyn Mensch.Depending on elevation and location within the mountain range, the snow totals will vary from an inch or two, all the way up to 8-10 inches in the higher elevations during the Tuesday/Wednesday time frame.It is a hopeful sign, as many locations in the West are suffering from extreme drought conditions.\"We are hoping to get more precipitation in the mountains going into this winter season, but a lot of that is going to depend on how the larger-scale systems set up, which is harder to tell farther out,\" said Mensch.In 2020, the Rockies received their first significant snow of the season as early as September 8, but did not have much of a showing afterward.Many thought the snow season was a bust until an historic snowstorm in March brought many locations snow totals up to the normal range with a single snow event.Denver saw 27 inches of snow in the March snowstorm, which broke records and proved anything can happen in the Rockies during the winter months.\"In Steamboat we have already had the first few dustings of the season and that got everyone really excited. But once the snow falls and starts falling and staying on the ground, thats when people really start turning their focus to winter,\" said Steamboat Springs communications director Loryn Duke.Snow is not only crucial for groundwater, but for the nearly $5 billion economic impact it has on the state of Colorado alone.\"In the old days we used to say snow makes the phone ring and now we say snow makes the website visits spike. As soon as they hear there will be snow in Colorado, they will start looking into Steamboat and thinking about their ski vacations,\" said Duke.An industry also hit by the COVID pandemic is now bouncing back, after reinventing they way they do things in the new COVID world.\"One of the things we as a ski resort and a ski industry recognize is the importance of outdoor recreation for both physical health and mental health. To be in the wide open spaces and to breathe the fresh air, that was important. But to also free your mind of all the troubles that were going on and to be able to be immersed in nature, its such a reset and important for mental health,\" said Duke.We know an early snow does not always mean a good snow season. There are so many factors to determine if this will be a good snow year or not.But with nearly 90% of the state of Colorado currently experiencing some sort of drought, like much of the west, they are rooting for a successful season.\"We have all the tools in our kit to assist mother nature and then once mother nature shows up, we are ready to welcome her,\" said Duke.Two systems to watch in the tropicsThere are two areas in the Atlantic that have a low chance of tropical development over the next five days, highlighted in yellow.Its been nearly a week since we have had a named system to watch in the Atlantic.The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring two areas in the Atlantic. Both have a slim chance of development over the next five days.One is located about 350 miles east-southeast of the Windward Islands. The system will move west-northwest at about 15 mph during the next few days and inch closer to the Lesser Antilles.\"Strong upper-level winds are expected to limit further development on Tuesday,\" said the National Hurricane Center (NHC). \"Regardless of development, the system could produce locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds across portions of the central and northern Lesser Antilles on Tuesday, and across the Virgin Islands and Leeward Islands on Wednesday.\"This system has only a 20% chance of development during the next five days.The other system we are watching is located over the Caribbean Sea and does not show many signs of life either.\"Environmental conditions are not expected to support development of this system for the next day or two,\" said the NHC. \"However, some gradual development is possible beginning on Wednesday when the system nears the southeastern Bahamas.\"The system will produce showers and storms across portions of the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola during the next couple of days.At this point in the season, tropical systems will often flare up closer to home.Areas around the Bahamas and just off the southeast coast of the US are prime locations for storm development. We also watch the Gulf of Mexico closely at this point in the season for storm potential.The waters in these locations are still very warm and could support a storm, if something were to develop.Tornado potential remains for the second straight dayArea at risk for severe storms on Monday highlighted in red and area at risk for severe storms on Tuesday highlighted in purple.A severe weather threat continues today after an active day Sunday across the Plains.The first of two storms is tracking from the Plains into the Midwest today, with a level 2 of 5 risk for severe weather, covering more than 20 million people.Areas of concern include Chicago, Indianapolis, Milwaukee and St Louis. The main threat will be damaging winds, but a few tornadoes are also likely.A new and stronger storm will move into the Plains tomorrow and again increase the threat for severe weather through the Plains, where some locations are already under a level 3 of 5 risk for severe weather and tornadoes.The main threat for the systems will be for portions of Oklahoma and much of central Kansas.We could see periods of torrential rainfall and hail. Very gusty winds will also be a threat, with the possibility of isolated tornadoes.More than a dozen tornadoes were reported Sunday. Most of them occurred in Oklahoma, with a few reported in extreme southwest Missouri.Those areas will be surveyed this week to confirm whether they were actual tornadoes or straight-line winds. It will also be determined how strong the tornadoes were.Californias fire potential is growing this weekStrong winds from the north to northwest combined with low humidity values and dry fuels lead to critical fire weather conditions across California on Monday.More than 45 million people are under wind alerts today, where wind gusts of more than 55 mph are possible.Strong winds and dry conditions in California will lead to level 2 of 3 critical fire danger.Red flag warnings cover much of California, where new fires could develop today. There are currently 11 active large fires burning across the state.Little to no rain is forecast this week, so dry conditions will prevail. Windy conditions will only make fire conditions worse.Portions of the San Joaquin Valley in California will experience winds gusting to 45 mph, where the KNP Complex fire is burning in Sequoia National Park.Antarcticas last 6 months were the coldest on recordIn a year of extreme heat, Antarcticas last six months were the coldest on record.For the entire Antarctic continent, the winter of 2021 was the second-coldest on record, with the \"temperature for June, July, and August 3.4 degrees Celsius (6.1 degrees Fahrenheit) lower than the 1981 to 2010 average at -62.9 degrees Celsius (-81.2 degrees Fahrenheit),\" according to a new report from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\"This is the second-coldest winter (June-July-August months) on record, behind only 2004 in the 60-year weather record at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station,\" the NSIDC said.Lava blocks the size of buildings falling from La Palma volcanoJUST WATCHED River of volcanic lava engulfs home Replay More Videos ...

Theyve been tossed around and risked their lives for the sake of hurricane research and keeping communities safe.Now they have a new partner, which will be on the water with eyes inside the storm from sea level. Yes, riding the waves beneath major hurricanes, experiencing conditions on the sea no human could endure.In a world first, a @saildrone has captured video from inside a hurricane. The Saildrone battled Hurricane #Sam s 50-ft waves and 120+ mph winds to collect critical scientific data and give us a brand new view of one of earths most destructive forces. https://t.co/vWHJUo1y2r pic.twitter.com/gO22wBhua2Its called a Saildrone, and its technology has reinvented the way we see the inside of hurricanes.Saildrone, Inc. has partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to better study hurricanes and the environment around them.\"What drives the intensity of the hurricanes is the transfer of heat and moisture from the ocean to atmosphere and the dynamics of how that occurs isnt well-understood,\" said Richard Jenkins, founder and CEO of Saildrone, Inc. \"So if we can measure how much is in the ocean and understand the physical principles of how that heat is transferred, thats the piece the models are missing.\"By better understanding the surface data around the storm as well as within it, they hope they will be able to provide crucial data to help better understand the environment in which hurricanes form, as well as how they rapidly intensify.Their hope is the data they collect will help hurricane forecasts in the future.A 23-foot Saildrone can stay out to sea for up to a year. The vehicle is wind-powered and its instruments are solar-powered, giving it the ability to enter some of Earths most hostile environments.They have already been used for mapping the ocean floor in Florida to help with storm surge forecasts, climate change missions and now they are navigating the high seas for hurricane research.This hurricane season, five Saildrones were placed in the Atlantic in locations predetermined by NOAA, where they would have the best shot at sampling a hurricane.When Hurricane Sam became Saildrones first hurricane mission, NOAA released the first-ever video from an uncrewed surface vehicle from inside a major hurricane.\"It was larger than we expected and hoped for but it was a great success. We emerged unscathed from that storm, which was a huge achievement from an engineering standpoint,\" said Jenkins.Sam was a Category 4 hurricane at the time of the mission, which left the Saildrone battling 50-foot waves and winds of more than 120 mph.The Saildrones \"hurricane wing\" enables the vessel to navigate extreme winds and waves.Sam has since moved north and is in the higher latitudes, bringing giant swells to places as far away as the Bahamas and eastern US. The storm is expected to impact Greenland by the end of the week.And the Saildrone mission will continue. They hope to expand the program and eventually have Saildrones in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico to sample storms and provide critical data from the surface of the storm, to supplement information gathered by the hurricane hunters who will continue to fly through them.Many times the Saildrones will be sailing just beneath the hurricane planes.\"Both are vital,\" said Jenkins. \"The planes are trying to get an accurate pressure reading from the center of the storm, which they do very well. We are trying to get surface dynamics. We get about 20 additional measurements that include the air and sea integration principles that are crucial to the future understanding of hurricanes. So we are getting different kinds of variables.\"Hopefully the data will help improve forecasts in the future, ultimately saving lives from monster hurricanes and catastrophic flooding.More than a months worth of rain this weekWhile the South has avoided tropical systems for the past couple of weeks, a deluge of tropical rains will soak the region this week, bringing the potential for flooding.An abundance of Gulf moisture will feed into the Southeast region, ahead of a very, very slow-moving cold front, bringing scattered showers and storms to much of Alabama, Georgia, the Florida Panhandle and the Carolinas.Showers will also reach as far north as the Ohio Valley. The highest amounts will primarily be across Alabama and Georgia through Friday.\"Due to the nature of the todays convection, today will be more of the primer day that saturates any dry spots,\" said the National Weather Service in Atlanta.However, as the week progresses and the ground becomes more saturated, the flood threat will increase.\"With little progression and storms continuing to train through the terrain, the risk for excessive rainfall and localized flash flooding will remain elevated,\" said the Weather Prediction Center.Places like Atlanta, Birmingham and Montgomery could see more than a months worth of rain in just a few days.Atlanta typically averages 3.28 inches of rain in the month of October and could see as much as four to six inches by Friday.Birmingham usually receives 3.34 inches of rain in October and could be looking at three to five inches by Friday.Theres also an area the National Hurricane Center is keeping an eye on, which could end up bringing more rain to the Southeast.Its currently over the Bahamas, but will journey to the northwest during the next few days.Theres only a 10% chance of development during the next five days, but it could bring some additional showers to the Georgia and Carolina coast by the end of the week.The California oil spill is an environmental nightmareJUST WATCHED Why California oil spill will likely spread Replay More Videos ...

Theres significant impacts to wildlife there,\" said Orange County Supervisory Katrina Foley. \"These are wetlands that weve been working with the Army Corps of Engineers, with (a local) land trust, with all the community wildlife partners to make sure to create this beautiful, natural habitat for decades. And now in just a day, its completely destroyed.\"The waters just off the coast of Southern California are among the most fertile fish habitats found anywhere on earth. In an ironic twist, they are directly related to the oil rigs offshore, in place since the late 1960s.2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences analyzed the 23 oil rigs located off the coastline and found the mean annual total fish production on this seafloor was as much as 27 times higher per square meter than similar depths around the world.Ironically, they estimated the \"complex hardscape habitat\" created by oil platforms, structures and pipelines throughout the water column has supported an incredible influx of fish biodiversity.A 2007 oil spill in the San Francisco Bay released 58,000 gallons of oil, (half of the current spill) and killed more than 7,000 birds.After one of the driest years on record, it will take multiple years for some states to recoverA house boat sits docked in a section of Lake Powell, as severe drought grips parts of the Western United StatesRecord drought, wildfires, and water shortages have beleaguered the western US, and the forecast is not much brighter.A new water year began on October 1, with many in the west hoping for a better year to come.Downtown Sacramento has officially gone 196 days without measurable rain, which breaks the record for the longest dry streak, set in 1880.Bakersfields 2020-2021 water year was the fifth-driest on record. Precipitation records there date back to 1892.Downtown San Franciscos most recent water year ended as the second-driest on record, and record keeping goes back more than 170 years.What is needed for California and other western states is multiple years of surplus rains, but also snow.

Find updates each week here .(CNN) Its that time in hurricane season when meteorologists like myself like to see the light at the end of the tunnel.But the reality is that its not close enough yet -- in fact, this year its not close at all.\"We still have two months to go in what has been a very active season,\" says National Hurricane Center meteorologist Dennis Feltgen. \"While we dont expect to have as many named storms as we had in 2020, were at 19 right now with the possibility of one or two more by the end of the week.\"If thats the case, we finish up all the names in the current list and move to the subsequent list before the month begins.Wanda is the last name on the 2021 hurricane name list, which could be used by the end of the week.After the record-shattering season in 2020, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with the Greek alphabet as the list we would use if we ran out of hurricane names.Instead, they decided to go with a completely new set of names, if the original list was exhausted.We are well on track to tap into that list. If so, the first name after Wanda would be Adria. Then Braylen. Then Caridad and Deshawn and so on. See the full list at the bottom of the NHC page hereThis season has been busy, no doubt. But how does it stack up to the busiest season of all time?We decided to compare where we are so far this year to where we were on September 27 of last year.Number of named storms: 23 in 2020 vs 19 in 2021Number of hurricanes: 8 in 2020 vs 7 in 2021Number of named storms (tropical and hurricane) making US landfall: 8 in 2020 vs 8 in 2021Number of hurricane landfalls in US: 4 in 2020 vs 2 in 2021If you just look at the numbers alone, it looks like 2020 outpaced 2021 up to now.By this time last year, we were already in the Greek alphabet and we had had four hurricane landfalls along the US coastline.Hanna and Isaias were both Category 1 storms, Sally was a Category 2 and Laura was a Category 4 storm.This year, we have had two hurricanes make landfall along the US coast. Nicholas was a Category 1 and Ida was a Category 4 storm. Both Category 4 storms, Laura and Ida, made landfall along the Louisianas coast.Thats two Category 4 storms impacting the same state in back-to-back years.With more storms expected, the chance of a hurricane making landfall is quite plausible in the US.We still have about two more months left in the season, and with La Niña expected to kick in, we could see an uptick in October systems, just like we did last year.Last year, October was a busy month. Four more hurricanes were produced in the month of October, two of those making landfall in Louisiana.Delta was a Category 2 storm that made landfall in Creole, Louisiana, very near where Laura made landfall just a few weeks prior.Zeta was a Category 3 storm that made landfall in Louisiana in October 2020 near Cocodrie.It was a devastating year for the state, and was followed up by what happened this year with Ida. A state with one of the most vulnerable coastlines in the US has been beaten the hardest with tropical systems for the last two years in a row.As we roll into October, we could have similar dynamics as 2020.Typical areas of storm development in October.La Niña is expected to develop in the coming weeks, which makes conditions more favorable for development in the Atlantic basin.The timing of when La Niña sets up will be key. \"We are currently in a La Niña watch. A lot will depend upon when it arrives,\" says Feltgen.So while it looks likely that we will see more development in the coming weeks, the only unknown is how many, if any, will impact the US coast.\"Florida is especially vulnerable in October, as a prime development area is in the northwest Caribbean Sea,\" says Feltgen.We typically see storms form in October a little closer to home.\"As the season progresses into October, the water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean start to cool and wind shear increases, so the majority of the tropical activity shifts back into the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, where water temperatures are usually still very warm,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Tropics stay active with 4 systems to watchThe four areas to watch in the Atlantic basin this week.Right now, the tropics are very active, which is typical for this time of year.We have Hurricane Sam, which was a Category 4 major hurricane at its peak over the weekend. Sam has weakened some but is still a major Category 3 hurricane. Luckily, Sam is going to stay out to sea and not impact the US.Peter has petered out southeast of Bermuda, but could redevelop over the next few days as it becomes more organized. Peter wont be a threat to the US, either.Two areas we should watch are much farther away.Two waves off the coast of Africa each have an 80% chance of development over the next five days. Both systems are traveling westward at about 10 mph.Its still far too early to know if these will have an impact to the US, but they are both worth keeping an eye on.If these two systems are named, one will be Victor and the other Wanda.More fires could ignite due to windsA Chinook firefighting helicopter carries water to drop on the fire as the KNP Complex fire in the Sequoia National Park continues to rage.Rain has returned and temperatures are cooling for much of the Pacific Northwest, helping firefighters on the ground battling the eight large fires burning across Washington and Oregon.In California, more than 10,000 firefighters are on the front lines, fighting 10 active wildfires.According to Cal Fire , \"Since the beginning of the year, there have been 7,686 wildfires that have burned more than 2.4 million acres in California.\"Red-flag warnings are currently up for portions of the Sierra Nevada in eastern California and western Nevada.Winds will be blowing at 15-25 mph with gusts of 40-50 mph. The fire danger will remain critical for these areas through Tuesday.\"Containment of the fires has gone up significantly over the past few weeks, but wind gusts from 40 to 50 mph can quickly expand the fires again,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.The Santa Ana winds will also be increasing for Southern California. This could mean more fires for the southern part of the state.\"Clearly, with so many small and large fires across California the last thing needed will be the gusty winds that are forecast to blow over the next few days,\" said Myers.\"As fall season begins, it is important to remember that some of the largest and most destructive wildfires occur during this time of year. Be prepared and do not let your guard down,\" says Cal Fire.Learn ways to prevent sparking a wildfire hereThe first full week of fall could feel anything but for someIts the first full week of autumn, but the traditional fall feeling of cool, crisp mornings with beautiful foliage on the trees might not happen for everyone yet.Many states in the Northeast and Southeast are getting a much-needed reprieve from the summer heat, with the vast majority of locations within just a few degrees of seasonal norms.But as you travel west, especially in and around the Rocky Mountains, the temperatures begin to resemble summer more than autumn.You might just want to put your Pumpkin Spice Latte on ice if you live out West.La Palma volcano continues to eruptJUST WATCHED Lava swallows swimming pool and homes in Spain Replay More Videos ...

They both look like they will be \"fish\" storms -- meaning they will stay out to sea.Peter has winds of 50 mph and is moving to the north-northwest.\"There are a lot of thorns in the way of Rose blossoming into a stronger storm,\" said the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in a rare light-hearted discussion about the storm.This storm could bring some showers to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as it makes a close brush, otherwise the storm doesnt pose a risk to coastal areas.Rose has winds of 40 mph and will continue in a generally NW motion during the next several days, staying out to sea.\"At longer range, stronger shear and dry air should pull the petals off Rose one-by-one, causing the cyclone to slowly weaken,\" said the NHC.Hurricane season is far from overWith roughly two and a half months left in the hurricane season, we are just passed the midway point and just passed the peak of the season.

There are still more storms to come,\" said Myers.While we have had a series of cold fronts during the last week or two, that doesnt mean the season is over.\"Cold fronts and large dips in the jet stream do tend to turn Atlantic storms northward, but we will still have to monitor the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico regardless,\" said Myers.So far this season, Tropical Storm Rose is the 17th named storm for the 2021 hurricane season.This is only the third time we have reached at least 17 named storms by this point in the season, according to Dr. Philip Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University.There are only four names left on the list for the Atlantic basin: Sam, Teresa, Victor and Wanda.If we use the last four names, we will go to the subsequent list that was developed to go in place of the Greek alphabet that was used in the pastLa Niña is expected to develop in the coming weeks, which could make the last several weeks of hurricane season interesting.We usually see an uptick in Atlantic storms during La Niña, so if that weather pattern takes hold with enough time left in the season, we could see an increase in activity.\"I do expect the rest of the season to be quite busy,\" said Klotzbach. \"We saw this scenario on steroids last year. Lets hope we dont have another October-November like we had last year, but I think the large-scale should favor another active end to the season.\"Fires in the west now threatening some of the worlds largest treesThis satellite image by Copernicus shows the KNP Complex fire in California moving towards the site of General Sherman, the largest single stem tree in the world.This satellite image shows the KNP complex fire in California burning ever more closely to the largest single stem tree in the world, the General Sherman.There are currently more than 100 wildfires burning across the west, including the KNP fire, which has now scorched over 23,000 acres.This fire is on the fringes of Sequoia National Park, threatening some of the worlds largest treesWhile this part of California is not under a red flag warning on Monday, a big chunk of the state is.Northern Sierra Nevada, Southern Cascades, and Associated Eastern Foothills are all included in the red flag warning.\"Gusty north to east wind expected over portions of interior Northern California today into early Tuesday. Combined with lowering humidity and dry fuels will result in areas of critical fire weather conditions,\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Sacramento.Northeast to east winds of 10 to 25 mph with gusts of 30 to 40 mph are expected in this region. This will only make fire conditions worse as the winds fan the flames and help spread the fires rapidly.Fall temps are spot onJUST WATCHED Happy fall! Heres why leaves change color Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Happy fall! Heres why leaves change color 01:19The fall equinox arrives on Wednesday and it seems as if Mother Nature is playing along, too.A strong cold front will progress across the country, bringing a chance of strong storms, then followed by fall-like temps for a large chunk of the country.There is a slight risk of severe weather on Monday for places like Des Moines and Cedar Rapids in Iowa and Madison, Wisconsin. Strong winds and damaging hail will be the main threats.However, we cant rule out the possibility of an isolated tornado.Behind the front, temps will fall. Chicago will get up to 81 on Monday, then top out at 70 on Tuesday.By Wednesday, Chicagos high will struggle to make it to the 60s, with gusty winds. Winds could be gusting 35 to 40 mph at times making temperatures feel even cooler.Even Atlanta will feel a nice dip, for southern standards. Tuesdays high will be around 80, then by Thursday the sun returns and highs will be in the low 70s.The dip in humidity will be a refreshing change. Washington DC will also see a ten-degree drop between Tuesday and Thursday.While the changes in temperatures wont be too drastic, the feel in the air will be hinting that fall really is finally here.The fall equinox occurs when the sun is directly over the equator, which results in day and night to be equal in length.It also marks the first day of astronomical fall.These neighborhoods swelter due to a racist 20th-century policyResidents in the low-income communities across south and southwest Atlanta are struggling to cope with the hottest summer across the US since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.Heat waves are the most lethal weather-related disaster in America.And these health risks are not distributed equally. During extreme heat events, a few city blocks can mean the difference between a manageable 80-degree afternoon or a sweltering, 100-degree sweat fest.The staggering temperature difference is due in large part to historical redlining, a federal government-sanctioned effort that began in the 1930s that amplified segregation by denying loans and insurance to potential home buyers in poorer neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color.While the racist practice was banned in the late 1960s, its effect is still apparent.The harvest moon shining bright before FallIf you are lucky enough to have cloud-free skies, youll be in for a treat.

This story was originally sent as a weather alert. Sign up for email alerts from CNN meteorologists and reporters in the field.(CNN) As we are now at the official peak of hurricane season, I remind myself that hurricane season is a marathon, not a sprint. Its a long season of constantly looking at forecasts and being nervous about when the next big storm will show up in forecast models.I also wanted to update you on where we stand with hurricane season, now that we have officially hit the peak of the season, and it looks like the second half shows no sign of slowing down.Its also a reminder that it doesnt take a \"big\" storm to have a major impact.Nicholas could be one of those storms. Just a few weeks ago, the Northeast received extreme rains -- and that was just the remnants of Ida.If you are in Texas or Louisiana, bookmark CNNs lite site in case of low bandwidth.The center of Nicholas keeps movingWhen storms such as Nicholas dont get their act together and become organized, it becomes difficult to find the center of circulation in the storm.With this storm, it has been even more difficult. The center keeps falling apart and reforming, at times 90 to 100 miles from its last position. This makes forecasting where the storm will make landfall -- and where it might do the most damage -- all the more difficult.Earlier this morning, the storms center emerged more than 100 miles from its previous location. And again, it seemed with the 11 a.m. ET advisory to be falling apart in one location and reforming in a new location.\"The earlier near-eyewall pattern dissipated a few hours ago, and has been replaced with what appears to be an ongoing reformation of a new center about 90 miles north-northeast of the old center,\" said the National Hurricane Center.Hurricane hunters are currently en route to investigate the storm. But with Nicholas seemingly inching closer to the coast with each new center formation, there will inevitably be an earlier landfall.Still, there could be a small window of time for Nicholas to strengthen.\"Strengthening is still expected until landfall as Nicholas continues to move over slightly warmer Gulf waters,\" said the hurricane center. \"It is possible that Nicholas could become a hurricane just before landfall.\"Nicholas is a 60-mph tropical storm and moving to the north at 12 mph. The speed has increased a little since earlier this morning. However, the storm is still expected to move very slowly during the next few days.This means one thing: FLOODING.20 inches of rain is not out of the question\"Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 8 to 16 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches, across portions of the middle and upper Texas coastal areas through the middle of the week,\" said the hurricane center.Yes, you read that correctly: We could see FEET of rain from this storm.And a lot of that rain could fall in a very, very short period of time. Potentially 3 to 4 inches an hour could fall during the peak of the storm.This means you should stay hyper-aware in case a flood watch is issued for your area. The duration in which the rain falls is a huge factor in how bad the flooding will be, but theres a strong possibility that some areas will experience a great deal of rain in a short amount of time, which will lead to flash flooding.Parts of Louisiana could also see high water. \"Across the rest of coastal Texas into southwest Louisiana rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected. This rainfall may produce areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, especially in highly urbanized metropolitan areas,\" said the hurricane center.Its certainly possible for some areas that were impacted by Ida to get additional rain from Nicholas. South-central and southeast Louisiana could pick up as much as 4 to 6 inches of rain during the next three days as Nicholas slowly slides up the Texas coast and moves into Louisiana.Its hard to know at this point where the worst of the rain will set up. We know that this area is the highlighted region where the most rain will most likely fall.Twenty inches of rain could have huge implications, especially if it falls in only a day or two. We saw what happened in New York two weeks ago with 8 inches of rain in less than a day. Of course, NYC and the Texas coastline are not apples and apples.Now parts of the coast, including Houston suburbs, are at high risk of flooding. This is the same threat level of flooding that was issued to the Northeast ahead of the catastrophic flooding due to Idas remnants.To determine how much rain a certain region can endure, you have to consider many factors. For one, urbanization plays a huge role. If a majority of the rain falls in Houston, we could see more implications than if the water fell along coastal areas.The topography also plays a role. With the Texas coast being relatively flat, the region can hold more water. But FEET of rain inundating an area means the potential for life-threatening flooding will be real with Nicholas.Why?The reason for the flooding potential is that Nicholas is moving so slowly. A slow-moving storm will produce higher amounts of rain. We saw it with Harvey in 2017 over Texas . And the climate crisis has showed us that storms will be slower and wetter in this warmer world we live in.As of now, this does not look like a Harvey event, but the forecast does show a significant flash flood threat that needs to be taken seriously. Harvey dumped widespread amounts of 20 inches of rain -- with isolated amounts of more than 40 inches -- across southeast Texas.Storm surge and tornadoesIn addition to the excessive rainfall, we will see storm surge. Portions of the Texas coastline could see 3 to 5 feet of storm surge. Galveston Bay could get 2 to 4 feet. Because Nicholas is moving so slowly, we could see the storm surge last for several high tide cycles, only making the flooding worse.Tornadoes will remain a threat during the next few days because of Nicholas. It is very common to see tornadoes with tropical systems. The areas with the greatest threat will be right along the coast from Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi.Preparing for flash flooding? What to do?The best way to prepare for a flash flood is know whether you are in a flood zone. You should stay knowledgeable about what rivers and streams are near you and what those flood stages are. More people die in flooding than in tornadoes and hurricanes.Two out of three people who die in flooding die in their cars. Its incredibly important not to be on the roads during a flooding event. Most people receive alerts on their phones in the event of a flash flood emergency. Make sure you can get alerts.Mobile phone -- Wireless emergency alerts are one of the best ways to receive warnings anytime, anyplace. On an IOS device go to settings, then notifications, and scroll to the bottom. Make sure emergency alerts -- listed under government alerts -- are turned on. If you use a third-party app, be sure the alerts are issued in a timely fashion. Most importantly, have those notifications turned ON.Water can rise quickly in a flash flood event; make sure that you are not in your car when this happens.If a flash flood warning is issued for your area, get to higher ground as quickly as possible. Do not wade in floodwater. It could be contaminated or electrically charged. Also, never drive through flooded roads. It only takes 2 feet of water to wash away most cars, including SUVs and pickup trucks.Where we stand this hurricane seasonWe are 14 named storms into the season right now, and we still have a little less than half the season to go.\"I do expect the rest of the season to be quite busy,\" said Phil Klotzbach, research scientist at Colorado State University.Forecast models suggest we are headed into a La Niña pattern, which means a more active hurricane season for the Atlantic basin.\"This type of scenario typically enhances conditions for a robust Caribbean low-level gyre that typically spins up late-season storms. We saw this scenario on steroids last year. Lets hope we dont have another October-November like we had last year, but I think the large scale should favor another active end to the season,\" said Klotzbach.Just because we have passed the \"peak\" of hurricane season doesnt mean that storms will be on the decline. We could see just as strong and impactful storms during the second half of the season.The hurricane center is also watching two other areas for possible development. An area of low pressure is expected to form north of the southeastern Bahamas this week and move northwest toward the eastern United States. This has a 50% chance of development during the next five days, according to the hurricane center. Areas from the Outer Banks to the mid-Atlantic need to closely monitor this for development.The other area is a tropical wave off the coast of Africa. It has an 80% chance of development during the next five days as it travels westward over the open tropical Atlantic. This will be something to closely monitor as we get into next week.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/13/weather/analysis-nicholas-erratic-behavior-hurricane-season-wxn/index.html"}, {"title": "The flooding in New York left weather experts with a dreadful feeling in the pit of their stomachs", "data_published": "2021-09-06T17:12:11Z", "content": "CNN Weather produces a weekly column, publishing Mondays with the weather news you should be aware of and the weeks hurricane outlook. Find updates each week here .(CNN) As meteorologists, we are still stunned by what happened in the Northeast last week. The flooding was forecast, but to see New York City underwater was not something anyone could have imagined.\"As you see it unfold, youre just gripped with this growing pit in your stomach when you look at this data on your screen and it keeps adding up to something very bad happening,\" said Alex Lamers, meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.As the world watched what occurred in the Northeast due to the remnants of Hurricane Ida, jaws dropped as the stunning images started to emerge.It wasnt because the forecast was a bust. In fact, the forecast was spot-on. Three days in advance, the prediction center was watching the potential for major flooding. It labeled last Wednesday as a \"high risk\" day for extreme rainfall. That only happens about 4% of the time, so these days are taken seriously in the weather community.Quick review of WPC Excessive Rainfall Outlooks leading up to the historic Northeast corridor flash flood event from post-tropical Ida. All warnings were at least contained within the Moderate Risk, and the High Risk area was almost entirely covered by warnings. pic.twitter.com/rQxalDUpfxLamers was at the prediction center that day, watching it go down in real time. So, I (Jennifer Gray) decided to call him and get his thoughts on what happened that day.\"Over the course of the day there was just a growing concern. As things started coming together and seeing how the storm would likely track and the possibility that this would move right up the interstate into (New York City), and thats what happened,\" said Lamers.While the rainfalls totals were staggering, what was even more stunning was how fast the rain came down.\"The fact you had those extreme rain rates that aligned over that densely populated area is why it unfolded the way it did,\" said Lamers.So much rain in such a short amount of time is what ultimately led to the catastrophe.Its one thing to have an inch of rain fall over the course of the day; its another to have that inch fall in 10 minutes. Forecasting exactly where the heaviest bands of rain will occur is impossible until a few hours before, and to see them set up over such a populated city as New York City was shocking.\"I think the thing that stands out to me are the heaviest rain rates were lined up perfectly with one of the most densely populated cities in the country. Twenty to 30 miles can make a huge difference. JFK had less than 3 inches, while Newark had over 9,\" Lamers said, referring to two major airports.Near Elizabeth, New Jersey, more than 10 inches of rain was reported. More than three 3 of rain fell in Central Park in just one hour.\"There were exceptional rain rates. There was an observation in the Bronx with 4 inches of rain in an hour. Four inches of rain in an hour is going to cause problems in most places. Of course, it will have a much bigger impact in an area thats paved with a lot of concrete than sandy soils,\" said Lamers.Flooding in Queens after the remnants of Hurricane Ida caused catestropic flooding in the northeast.Subways had water rushing in, and people had to be rescued from their rooftops. And the nightmare didnt stop with the rain. Over a dozen tornadoes were also reported across many of these same areas. At least 46 people died in Idas second punch that impacted the East.It was a devastating day, caused by a storm that unleashed damage and heartbreak from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Idas path spanned 1,500 miles.\"If you look at the recent (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report and the most recent climate report, both of those have concluded that there have been observable increases with the intensity and frequency of intense rainfall events. This increase is expected to continue in a warming world. Because of the basic principle that warmer air on average can hold more water vapor,\" said Lamers.Lamers encourages people to be ready if theres ever another \" high risk \" day. Plan ahead just as you would if your area was issued a tornado watch. Be alert.Try not to get on the roads unless absolutely necessary. He says 2 out of every 3 people who die in flooding die in their cars. And of course, never drive through flooded waters.\"I think we are going to be dealing with extreme rainfall events for the foreseeable future, and we are going to do our best to equip people the best we can to make decisions when theres an extreme rain event on the horizon,\" said Lamers.More flooding and extreme heat impact those hit by IdaA heat advisory and a flash flood watch were issued Monday for areas of Louisiana and Mississippi still recovering from Hurricane Ida.Residents along the Gulf Coast will continue cleanup this week after the devastation left by Ida. Unfortunately, more rain and extreme heat is in the forecast this week.More than 2 million people are under flash flood watches, as slow-moving storms could bring 2 to 3 inches of rain in a short amount of time. This includes in New Orleans, as well as some of the hardest hit areas such as Houma and LaPlace.The heat will also be an issue this week across the hard-hit Gulf Coast, where a heat advisory is in place for nearly 3 million people.More than half a million people still have no power, and many of those people are under this heat advisory. Heat index values could reach as high as 100 to 105 on Monday.The National Weather Service is encouraging residents to \"take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening.\" In fact, the weather service lowered the threshold for a heat advisory because so many people are without power.While cleanup is ongoing, many people could find themselves overexerting -- then not having a cool place to cool down.Its important to try to not get too hot or to find a cooling center nearby to find relief. Heat causes the most weather-related fatalities on average, according to the weather service.More on Ida:Peak of hurricane seasonThis week marks the peak of Atlantic hurricane season, and the tropics are active, with Hurricane Larry churning in the middle of the Atlantic and a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico.Lets begin with Larry. In case you missed it, Larry developed early last week, becoming a tropical storm on Wednesday and a hurricane the following day.Today , Larry maintains its Category 3, major hurricane status as it tracks through the open waters of the Atlantic.Fortunately, Larry is not forecast to make landfall, however it is generating large swells that are impacting the Lesser Antilles, the Bahamas and Bermuda.These significant swells are expected to impact the East Coast of the US and Atlantic Canada by the middle of the week. \"These swells will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the National Hurricane Center said on Monday.Bermuda may want to keep a close eye on Larry this week. The current forecast track has the hurricane tracking to the east of the island by Thursday, bringing with it the threat of strong winds, heavy rain and coastal flooding.\"While it is too soon to determine the magnitude of these hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda, interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates during the next several days,\" the hurricane center said on Monday.We are also monitoring a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico. This area of showers and thunderstorms is forecast to remain disorganized as it tracks across the Gulf towards Florida.This disturbance is expected to track across the Southeast US by midweek, increasing showers and storms across northern Florida and southern Georgia.Some development will be possible once this area of storms tracks into the Atlantic later this week. Portions of the coastal Carolinas may want to keep an eye on these storms late this week and into the weekend.Firefighters in the West gain ground, yet new fires emergePhotos: Wildfires raging in the West The Alisal Fire burns near Goleta, California, on Tuesday, October 12.

The fire has been burning since August 14, and now its is 44% contained.The Caldor Fire has destroyed more than 900 structures since it began, with more than 27,000 structures still threatened.In Amador County, near where the Caldor Fire is burning, the Lawrence Fire spread to 40 acres, burning grass, brush and timber, Cal Fire said.The fire prompted brief road closures and evacuations as it threatened a handful of structures, but firefighters quickly mitigated the threat. The Lawrence Fire was 30% contained Sunday evening.Farther north in Placer County, the Bridge Fire burned 250 acres with 0% containment as of Sunday evening.

Cayette, who uses a wheelchair, called parish officials for help. They never came.Parish officials, however, told CNN that they did not receive calls that match Cayettes situation, adding that the government is \"by law, not allowed to enter or conduct work on private property unless it is an emergency life saving measure.\" It wasnt until two days later when a group of volunteers from New Orleans came to saw and remove the trees that he was able to go outside.\"Ive seen it all,\" Cayette, a retired industry worker, told CNN. \"After Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the chemical plants started building and operating. A lot of them. It all changed.\"About 50 miles away in St. John the Baptist Parish, Robert Taylor Jr., executive director of Concerned Citizens of St. John, said many residents were trapped in their attics after the storm while others witnessed their roofs being ripped off by Ida.The lack of emergency response after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette.\"The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,\" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. \"And this just pushed it over the top.\"Milton Cayette Jr. was stuck in his home for two days before fallen trees could be cleared.The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisianas \"Cancer Alley,\" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge thats home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries. According to the Environmental Protection Agencys 2019 environmental justice data eight of the nations top 14 block groups — census areas that typically contain 600 to 3,000 people — with the countrys estimated highest cancer risks are in St. John.Until recently, Cayette, who has lived in the region for 70 years and previously worked at a nearby petrochemical plant, never connected the growth of the chemical industry to the regions suddenly high cancer rates. But then his wife died of breast cancer a few years ago -- and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer on top of his diabetes. Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window.\"I was mad and disappointed at the government,\" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. \"What concerned me even more is that Im disabled, but they couldnt come to help.\"For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of vulnerable residents in Louisiana and Mississippi, the EPA released an analysis concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves.People work to repair a roof in Norco, Louisiana.If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most countries are careening toward unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\"Its absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,\" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. \"Theyre also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.\"Compounding crises during a pandemicThe coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also five times higher than the overall national death rate.The Holy Rosary Cemetery in Hahnville, Louisiana, sits next to a Dow chemical plant.More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the areas high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the areas rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief.\"Its just risk on top of risk on top of risk,\" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. \"Theres always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.\"The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities.\"If only we can get some attention,\" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. \"The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.\"The Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John was damaged by Hurricane Ida.Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. In the early months of the pandemic, Harvards school of public health released a preliminary study showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19.Terrellwanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley.Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission.\"It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didnt ask for, and dont deserve to be burdened with,\" Terrell said.The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to data from Johns Hopkins University . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission.Many residents across Louisiana are still enduring power outages.Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 wont get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Idas impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrells concern.Prior to Ida, at least 16% of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data.\"This is a mess,\" Taylor told CNN. \"I dont see how poor people are expected to survive this.\"Living next to an industrial facilityThe proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate.When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to millions of pounds of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines.A damaged trailer is seen in Reserve, Louisiana, a town in St. John the Baptist Parish.\"This is not something new to these communities, and its not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,\" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. \"It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.\"In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Idas aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, officials noted that Shell is conducting \"community air monitoring\" and \"looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.\"\"While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. \"Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.\"In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops.Sharon Lavignes home was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ida.Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of.\"My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,\" Lavigne told CNN. \"And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.\"And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits from environmental groups like RISE St. James.While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isnt over, Hurricane Ida added to the communitys problems. The storm tore Lavignes roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish.A sign protesting the planned Formosa plant is seen next to a downed tree on Sharon Lavignes property.\"So many of us suffered damages from Ida,\" Lavigne said, \"so after RISE members rebuild, were going to help the rest of the community.\"Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said theyve been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting.\"People tell me theyre glad were fighting the industry,\" she said.\"Many tell me they cant be out there to help me, but theyre praying for me. That was nice.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/06/us/hurricane-ida-cancer-alley-pollution/index.html"}, {"title": "Here's why hurricane hunters fly their planes in weird patterns into storms", "data_published": "2021-09-19T08:42:40Z", "content": "(CNN) The second half of hurricane season is here and there have already been 17 named storms to keep hurricane hunters busy. But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes?Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm.Hurricane hunters dont fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they dont just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness.There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC).For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest.Fixed missionsFixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail.For fixed missions, Alpha is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone.\"The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so its the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,\" Maj. Jeremy DeHart , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserves 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron , said. \"The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.\"Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.Latest VDM from @53rdWRS mission indicates Hurricane #Larry no longer has a defined eyewall and the central pressure rose 3-4 mb between passes. Clear weakening trend. pic.twitter.com/0d9WiDTXVb — Jeremy DeHart (@JeremyDeHart53d) September 7, 2021Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the \"easier\" ones to fly in.\"From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the \"easiest\" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, theres not a lot of question where the storm center is,\" DeHart said. \"The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.\"Invest missionsThe primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics.For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point.However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms.\"We never know what were going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],\" DeHart said. \"Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe its closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.\"Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a variety of flight patterns to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few.DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet.\"Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,\" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing.Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude.\"The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that well fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, well continue the mission in invest mode,\" DeHart said.NOAA focuses on researchNOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique flight patterns , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned.Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions.For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern.\"The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,\" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations.The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side.\"The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storms various quadrants,\" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. \"This data helps with predicting a storms intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.\"For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating.\"The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we dont have a center to aim for,\" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAAs Aircraft Operations Center, said. \"Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), well shift back to Figure 4s based on that newly identified center position.\"The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists.There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go.The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation.Recently, NOAAs Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed.\"The flight pattern youll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,\" Underwood said. \"This data helps with predicting the storms track.\"Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm.The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/19/weather/weather-hurricane-hunter-flights/index.html"}, {"title": "This small Northern California town was ravaged by a wildfire for the second time in less than a year", "data_published": "2021-07-14T10:08:11Z", "content": "(CNN) A small town in Northern California has been ravaged by a wildfire for the second time in less than a year.Residents of Doyle, a town of about 700 residents north of Reno, are evacuating from their homes again as extreme drought and heat waves leave the area primed for wildfires.Californias largest wildfire on record this year, the Beckwourth Complex Fire, whipped through Doyle on Saturday, destroying 33 homes according to the local fire department.Just eight months ago, Doyle suffered extensive damage when a wind-driven wildfire destroyed 21 homes and 19 other structures in November, according to the Bureau of Land Management\"For this community, its devastating,\" Doyle Fire Protection District Chief Kathy Catron told CNN.Many residents forced to flee their homes have been staying with friends and family or in shelters while evacuation orders remain in place, Catron said.The Beckwourth Complex Fire, which was sparked on June 30, is not expected to be fully contained until July 30, according to the US Forest Service.

Thats 103,588 more acres than during the same time period last year, Cal Fire said.\"While wildfires are a natural part of Californias landscape, the fire season in California and across the West is starting earlier and ending later each year,\" Cal Fire said. \"Climate change is considered a key driver of this trend.\"Gusty winds fuel flamesThe US Forest Service, which is leading the battle against the Beckwourth Complex Fire, said it couldnt confirm the number of structures lost in Doyle because its still too dangerous for a damage assessment team to enter.Kimberly Kaschalk, a spokeswoman with the US Forest Service, said unusually dry conditions and numerous lightning strikes in the area were a factor in the fires growth.CNN Meteorologist Michael Guy said Doyles location on the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevadas leaves it open to downslope winds from the mountains, meaning gusty winds are common. The wind combined with arid conditions is fueling flames. Winds in the area will be picking up Wednesday afternoon and last through Thursday night with gusts up to 25 mph, Guy said, noting it could hamper firefighting efforts.Kaschalk told CNN officials are doing everything they can to keep residents and firefighters safe.

Three years later, he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for illegal border-crossing, larceny and robbery, to be followed by his deportation, according to a court judgmentThe notice offers a $15,600 reward for information that helps police catch Zhu.

The bounty notice was deleted from the Jilin prison polices social media account, and some related hashtags and posts were removed from Weibo -- including footage of Zhus escape.According to court documents, it was just past midnight on July 21, 2013, when Zhu -- a coal miner -- swam across the river from the northeastern tip of North Korea to a Chinese village in the city of Tumen, Jilin province.Within hours, he broke into several village houses to steal money, cell phones, sneakers and clothes. At the third house, an old woman discovered him and shouted for help, the court document said.\"I took out a knife tied to my waist and stabbed the granny in the back. Then I noticed she was carrying a satchel. I tried to yank it off her but she wouldnt let go, so I stabbed her a few times more,\" Zhu was quoted as saying in court.Zhu was arrested hours later when trying to flee in a taxi, the court document said. The old woman suffered severe injuries but survived, it added.While in prison, Zhus sentence was reduced twice -- in 2017 and in 2020 -- for a show of remorse, good discipline and actively participating in \"ideological, cultural and vocational education\" and laboring work, state broadcaster CCTV reported .

So when news emerged this week that the government wants to reduce abortions for \"non-medical reasons,\" the backlash was swift and furious.Chinese social media was flooded with comments from women fed up with what they see as government efforts to control their bodies, describing the apparent U-turn on abortion as a desperate attempt to boost the countrys dwindling birth rates\"The female body has become a tool,\" said one top comment on Weibo, Chinas Twitter-like platform. \"When (the state) wants you to bear a child, you must do it at all cost. When (the state) doesnt want it, youre not allowed to give birth even at the risk of death.\"The abortion policy was included in an expansive government blueprint to further womens rights over the next decade, covering areas ranging from education to employment, which state-run media boasted would improve gender equality \"to a higher level in the new era.\"The measure on abortion was part of a larger section about reproductive health that included provisions such as increasing health education and access to contraception. Beyond that brief sentence, however, no other details -- such as how the abortion restriction would be implemented or what criteria women would need to meet -- were provided.But the fact it was mentioned at all in the sweeping 10-year plan is concerning -- and could be part of the governments campaign to increase the birth rate as it faces a growing demographic crisis, said Leta Hong Fincher, author of \"Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China.\"\"This, of course, is not a red alert nationwide ban on abortion, which would create an enormous uproar,\" she said. \"But, in fact, its more obvious than I had anticipated because its coming in the form of this document issued by the State Council, a nationwide policy document.\"Despite its brevity, the line is \"a statement of central government policy, and it sends a signal to all of those local level (Communist Party) cadres that this is a priority of the central government,\" she added.Abortion has been widely practiced in China for decades. Under the one-child policy, introduced in 1979, millions of women a year were forced to terminate \"illegal\" pregnancies . The traditional preference for sons also led to a rise in sex-selective abortions, with families often choosing to abort girls. This has contributed to a significantly skewed gender ratio, with the 2021 census revealing there were almost 35 million more men than women in the country of 1.4 billion.But over the past decade, China changed tack completely as it began to reckon with the consequences of its one-child policy -- a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce that threatened the countrys economic growth.To raise its plummeting fertility rate, China enacted the two-child policy in 2016, then the three-child policy in August this year. The government has also launched an aggressive propaganda campaign urging women to have more children, with some local authorities even offering financial incentives for families.So far, their efforts have been met with a lukewarm response at best. Many women, who now enjoy greater educational and career opportunities than in the past, are reluctant to expand their families -- especially with other obstacles like a high cost of living and entrenched gender norms that relegate childcare to mothers.Abortions have also remained high, even after the one-child policy was relaxed and the government criminalized sex-selective terminations. An average of 9.7 million terminations were performed per year between 2014 and 2018, according to Reuters , citing data from Chinas National Health Commission.In response, authorities have increasingly voiced concern over abortions, with state media warning they were \"very harmful\" and could cause \"serious psychological disorders\" in unmarried women. In 2018, Jiangxi province banned abortions for non-medical reasons after the 14th week, joining several other provinces with similar rules in place.\"The entire history of population planning in China ... has been incredibly abusive and coercive,\" said Hong Fincher. \"So I think there is a lot of reason to be very concerned about this complete 180-degree turn in emphasis coming from the central government, saying that now, China needs to reduce the number of non-medical abortions.\"Some experts, however, caution its too soon to say what the impact will be -- especially since its not the first time the government has signaled such intentions. The last 10-year plan for womens development, published in 2011, also aimed to \"reduce the rate of abortion\" and of unwanted pregnancy in general by improving sexual education and access to contraception.\"This is not a new policy,\" said Feng Yuan, a feminist scholar and activist. \"Currently we dont see any reason for stricter (implementation).\"Besides, she added, several other countries also restrict terminations of pregnancies beyond 14 weeks for health and safety concerns. The reason the policy is prompting debate now is \"because the attention and focus on the issue has changed, where people are concerned about limits on their rights to control their bodies,\" she said.The government will also probably tread lightly on the issue, said Hong Fincher. Authorities are aware this is a delicate, controversial topic that could prompt public backlash, especially with growing awareness among women of their rights and bodily agency.the policy unveiled on Monday doesnt seem to bode well for women in the country. But still, when viewed in context of the governments accelerated push for children -- as well as its heavy crackdown on Chinas feminist movement in recent years --the policy unveiled on Monday doesnt seem to bode well for women in the country.\"Theres this rhetoric that the Communist Party was founded on the basis of gender equality ... its literally enshrined in the Constitution,\" said Hong Fincher.\"But the fact is, just looking at the evidence of quite a few years already ... the governments movement has been in opposition to furthering womens rights, in opposition to gender equality. I think that the direction is clear now.\"Missing citizen journalist resurfacesChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was silenced for reporting on the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, has resurfaced on social media.A Chinese citizen journalist who disappeared in February 2020 while reporting on the havoc of Chinas initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan has finally resurfaced on social media, making a cautious and somewhat subdued return as a boxing fan.Chen Qiushi , a former lawyer, arrived in Wuhan in late January last year -- a day after the central Chinese city was placed under the worlds first coronavirus lockdown. He visited overflowing hospitals, funeral parlors and makeshift isolation wards and uploaded videos of what he saw, offering the world a glimpse into the grim reality at the heart of the crisis.But Chen went missing after two weeks of critical reporting, and was later revealed to have been forced into quarantine by authorities, according to his friends and family.On Thursday, Chen suddenly broke his silence on Twitter. In a post to his 340,000 followers , he wrote about his new passion for boxing and announced he was organizing a fight to raise money for charity.\"Long time no see! In the past year and 8 months, Ive been through a lot -- some of which I can talk about, and some I cant. I believe you all understand,\" he wrote.\"During the darkest moment of my life, it was boxing that saved me. Boxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu not only gave me a healthy body, but also helped set me free from depression.\"His first public appearance in 19 months has come as a big surprise -- and relief -- to friends and fans. Less than 24 hours before Chens latest tweet, a friend who had been authorized to take over his Twitter account was still asking about his whereaboutsCNN has reached out to Chen for comment.Later on Thursday evening, Chen also appeared briefly in the YouTube livestream of his friend Xu Xiaodong, an outspoken mixed martial artist who campaigned for his release.\"I havent done any videos for a long time. Now I feel nervous facing the camera,\" he said, sitting next to Xu.Chen tiptoed around what exactly happened to him, but he did allude to the toll it had taken on his physical and mental health.\"When I first regained freedom, my health condition was very bad -- I would feel exhausted after walking for one or two kilometers,\" he said, adding that he also had depression.Chen said going forward, he wanted to devote himself to the promotion of boxing. \"The past will eventually pass. And the good days will eventually arrive. Lets add oil together,\" he said.But it appears even that was not tolerated by Chinese authorities. Hours after Chen made a comeback on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, his account was deletedChen was among a handful of journalists, activists and doctors silenced by the Chinese government for trying to tell the truth about the Wuhan outbreak.Last December, Zhang Zhan , an independent Chinese journalist, was sentenced to four years in prison for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" -- an offense commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists.Two other citizen journalists, Fang Bin and Li Zehua, still havent been heard from since they went missing in Wuhan last year.National celebrationThe Peoples Liberation Army perform a flag-raising ceremony at Beijings Tiananmen Square to mark the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China.

Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN) Beijing wants foreign vessels to give notice before entering \"Chinese territorial waters,\" providing maritime authorities with detailed information -- including the ships name, call sign, current position, next port of call and estimated time of arrival.It may sound like a reasonable enough request, especially if the ship is carrying hazardous goods, that is until you consider what constitutes \"Chinese territorial waters.\"Beijing asserts sovereignty over vast swathes of the South China Sea, under its widely contested and far-reaching nine-dash line, as well as disputed islands in the East China Sea.Begging the question, will China try to enforce the new law in disputed seas? If it does, Pacific powers like Japan and the United States almost certainly wont comply. And in such a scenario, the question quickly becomes, how will China react?As of September 1, five types of foreign vessels -- submersibles, nuclear-powered vessels, ships carrying radioactive materials, ships carrying bulk oil, chemicals, liquefied gas or other toxic substances, as well the seemingly catch all \"vessels that may endanger Chinas maritime traffic safety\" -- will be required by law to provide detailed information to state authorities on entering \"Chinese territorial waters,\" according to a notice released by Chinas maritime safety authorities last Friday.However, the regulations lack specifics and Western analysts say they skirt close to countering the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which guarantees a coastal state will not hamper the right of passage of foreign vessels if they dont threaten a nations security.\"This looks like part of Chinas strategy of casting legal nets over areas that it claims ... to normalize these claims,\" said Robert Ward, senior fellow for Japanese security studies at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\"Enforcement will be difficult, but this may matter less for Beijing than the slow accumulation of what it sees as a legal underpinning,\" Ward said.The new regulations are the second such instance of Beijing attempting to provide a legal justification for its maritime reach this year, following a law introduced in February that allows the Chinese Coast Guard to use weapons to protect Chinas national sovereignty, an action previously reserved for units of the Peoples Liberation Army.The main focus of both of Chinas new legal claims is widely considered to be the South China Sea, almost all of which Beijing claims as its sovereign territory, despite overlapping claims by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Taiwan.The US Coast Guards top commander in the Pacific, Vice Adm. Michael McAllister, on Friday called the new law \"very concerning,\" telling CNN that if enforced, it \"begins to build foundations for instability and potential conflicts\" in the South China Sea.The US has shown a staunch unwillingness to comply with Chinas demands in the region, routinely carrying out freedom of navigation operations, which challenge Beijings claims to disputed islands. During a speech in Singapore in July, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pushed back against what he described as Chinas illegitimate claims to the vast resource-rich waterway.But the more volatile area may be in the East China Sea, and the waters around the Japanese-held Senkaku Islands , claimed by China as the Diaoyus.\"Exercising coastal state rights is an important step in corroborating sovereignty through practice,\" said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at Kings College in London. \"But in spaces like the waters around the Senkaku Islands, a strict implementation of these navigational rules will inevitably lead to a clash with coast guard authorities of competing claimants like Japan.\"And, looking at the numbers, the forces that could precipitate a clash have been in place almost constantly this year.According to Japans Coast Guard, Chinese Coast Guard vessels have been in Japans territorial waters -- within 12 nautical miles of Japanese land -- 88 times this year. In the contiguous zone -- waters between islands but not within 12 miles of shore -- there have been 851 Chinese incursions, the Japan Coast Guard says.But China says its coast guard vessels are only patrolling its waters around its Diaoyu islands. According to Beijing, Japanese craft are the interlopers and China would be within its rights to use force to get rid of them.\"If the vessel is military and trespassing in Chinas territorial waters without advance notice, it will be considered as serious provocation, and the Chinese military will take over to dispel or take even stronger measures to punish the invaders,\" the state-owned Global Times nationalist tabloid reported this week, quoting a Chinese military expert.China has been ramping up legal pressure on the Senkakus since 2013, when it declared them part of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), with requirements similar to the latest Maritime Safety Administration rules. And that ADIZ has not resulted in armed clashes.But, as many analysts point out, combat often comes by mistake, not careful planning. A field commander eager to show his or her mettle, a mistaken order or miscommunication, a mechanical breakdown of a ship or plane -- any could be a spark that ignites a conflict.And in the current state of bellicose rhetoric between China and Japan, and its ally the United States, once shots are fired, it could be hard to back down.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/09/03/china/coast-guard-law-mic-intl-hnk/index.html"}, {"title": "Why is the Communist Party clamping down on China's biggest stars and fan clubs?", "data_published": "2021-08-30T06:32:10Z", "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNNs Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the countrys rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN) The crackdown came quickly and sweepingly, wiping out some of Chinas biggest stars and fan clubs in a matter of days.Over the past week, Chinas entertainment industry has become the latest to fall into the crosshairs of the ruling Communist Party, following Xi Jinpings clampdown on political dissent, social activism, ideological liberalism and private businesses.Zhao Wei, one of Chinas most prominent actresses, saw her presence mostly scrubbed from the countrys internet overnight. Her fan page on Weibo , Chinas heavily censored version of Twitter, was shut down. Movies and television shows she starred in -- some going as far back as two decades ago -- were taken off streaming platforms, with her name also removed from the cast lists.Broadcasters and video sites also removed the works of Zheng Shuang, another top Chinese actress who was fined $46 million for tax evasion on Friday. Zheng had been caught in a surrogacy scandal earlier this year, after her estranged partner accused her of abandoning their two babies in the United States.The erasure came as a list of \"misbehaving celebrities\" reportedly blacklisted by Chinas broadcast authorities circulated on social media on Thursday. Zhao and Zheng were both on the list, as well as Chinese Canadian pop star Kris Wu, who was arrested on suspicion of rape this month. It was not immediately clear why Zhao was targeted. CNN has reached out to her agent for comment.While individual Chinese celebrities have been targeted by the government before, the latest crackdown is wider in scope and harsher in severity, with their presence mostly wiped clean from the countrys internet -- so complete is their erasure, it has been likened by fans online to the formation of a black hole following the collapse of a star.Authorities also took aim at celebrity fan culture popular among Chinas youth. On Friday, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced 10 measures to \"clean up\" what it called the \"chaos\" of celebrity fan clubs, including banning any attempt to rank celebrities based on popularity, and tightening regulations around talent agencies and fan club accounts. A day earlier, popular video platform iQiyi canceled all idol talent shows , calling them \"unhealthy.\"On Chinese social media, some comments said the crackdown was reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution, a decade of political and social turmoil between 1966 and 1976 during which arts and culture were restricted to promoting party propaganda.The Communist Party, which views popular culture as a key ideological battleground, has long kept the entertainment sector on a tight leash with stringent censorship. But it has also encouraged its growth, supporting domestic films and shows intended to help win the Chinese public over from Hollywood and other foreign productions.But under Xi, the party has grown ever more obsessed with ideological and cultural control. The dazzle of stardom and the frenzy of fandom are increasingly viewed as a dangerous, pernicious influence -- especially on the countrys youth.For decades, robust economic growth has been a key pillar of legitimacy for the party. As the Chinese economy slows, Xi has invoked the need for \"common prosperity\" and pledged to redistribute wealth , with high-earning celebrities and business tycoons among the first to bear the brunt.The sky-high income of some A-list celebrities is a glaring reminder of Chinas gaping wealth gap. Zheng was reportedly paid more than $24 million for two and a half months of filming for a romantic drama, earning an average daily wage of more than $300,000. Last year, by way of comparison, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang revealed that more than 600 million Chinese were earning barely $140 per month.From an ideological perspective, the party wants celebrities to become role models in helping promote values such as patriotism and love for the government. Many have responded to the call.On social media, actors, singers, influencers and other entertainers have frequently acted as staunch defenders of the Chinese government, speaking up in support of Hong Kong police during the 2019 pro-democracy protests and leading the boycott earlier this year against Western brands over their stance against alleged forced labor in Xinjiang. Successful actors have also rushed to star in patriotic films and TV shows, and celebrities feel increasingly compelled to pledge millions of dollars in donations when a major disaster hits.But thats still not enough. The party sees the extravagant lifestyles of some celebrities as a sign of moral decay, and deems many of the popular male idols too \"effeminate.\" The extreme measures taken by some fans to defend their idols against perceived rivals, such as online abuse, doxxing and spreading rumors, have also drawn concerns.On Saturday, the partys anti-corruption watchdog lashed out at what it called \"toxic\" celebrity culture, accusing it of \"advocating wrong values\" in Chinese youth. \"If not guided and changed, itll have a huge destructive impact on the future life of young people and social morality,\" it said in a statement.But most pressingly, the party is alarmed by the fervent loyalty top celebrities command among young fans, who have demonstrated remarkable ability, both online and offline, to mobilize in support of their idols. Following Wus detention, some fans openly called for a \"rescue operation\" to help free him from police dentition -- drawing the censur e of the party and state media.While few would take the \"prison break\" plan seriously, for a ruling party obsessed with maintaining stability and control, it serves as a warning that some of the countrys young are willing to challenge its authority for a subject of worship other than itself.As for Chinese regulators, they have been upfront about the political intentions behind the clampdown.In its statement Friday, the CAC urged various authorities to carry out the crackdown with \"a sense of responsibility, mission and urgency,\" and to bear in mind that it was born of the need for \"safeguarding online political security and ideological security.\"Not scientifically credibleChina has denounced a US intelligence services report into the origins of Covid-19 as a fabrication, likening the investigation to the failed hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\"First, a report fabricated by the US intelligence community is not scientifically credible. The origin-tracing is a matter of science; it should and can only be left to scientists, not intelligence experts,\" said a statement released Friday by the Chinese Embassy in Washington.\"Now, the US side is using its old trick again. Ignoring the report by the WHO-China joint mission, it chooses to have its intelligence community put together a report instead. How can this possibly be science-based and reliable origin-tracing?\"The US intelligence community reached an inconclusive assessment about the origin of the Covid-19 virus following a 90-day investigation ordered by President Joe Biden, according to an unclassified summary of the probe released publicly on Friday. The report left open the possibility that the virus was leaked from a lab in the city of Wuhan as well as the theory that the virus passed from animals to humans.The statement alleged the US was trying to \"stigmatize\" China by accusing it of not being transparent about the origins of the disease.\"Since the outbreak of Covid-19, China has taken an open, transparent and responsible attitude. We have released information, shared the genome sequencing of the virus, and carried out international cooperation to fight the disease, all done at the earliest possible time\", the August 27 statement reads.China has repeatedly refused to share information relating to the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, and on on Friday repeated its own unfounded accusation that the virus may have emanated from a US military lab at Fort Detrick.\"Instead of finding out what happened in its own labs first, the US keeps slinging mud at others,\" said the statement, which called for a WHO investigation into the US laboratory.The statement concluded by alleging the intelligence report had not produced the answer the US had wanted. \"Continuing such an effort will also be in vain, because its subject is simply non-existent and anti-science,\" the statement said.-- CNNs Angus Watson contributed reportingA clean startA primary school teacher shows her students how to properly wear a mask in Lianyungang city, eastern Chinas Jiangsu Province, on August 30, ahead of the official start of the new semester on September 1. On Friday, Chinas health authorities announced that the countrys Delta variant outbreak has been \"effectively brought under control.\"Exhausted and without hope, East Asian youth are lying flatYoung people in China are getting tired of the fierce competition for college and jobs, and the relentless rat race once they get hired.Theyre now embracing a new philosophy theyve called \"tang ping,\" or \"lying flat.\"The phrase apparently traces its origins to a post earlier this year in an online forum run by the Chinese search giant Baidu. The author of the now-deleted post suggested that instead of working ones entire life chasing after an apartment and traditional family values, people should pursue a simple life.In other words, just \"lie flat.\"Talk of \"lying flat\" has spread rapidly through China as young people contend with intense competition for the most attractive jobs, especially in tech and other white-collar fields. As the country cracks down on private enterprise, meanwhile, the public has grown wary of what many see as a grueling work culture. Commonplace at many tech firms and startups are demands for people to work nearly double — or more — the number of hours in a typical work week.This type of phenomenon isnt limited to China. Across East Asia, young people say theyve become exhausted by the prospect of working hard for seemingly little reward.In South Korea, young people are giving up on marriage and home ownership. In Japan, they are so pessimistic about the countrys future that they are eschewing material possessions.\"Young people are very burnt out,\" said Lim Woon-taek, a professor of sociology at Keimyung University in South Korea. \"They dont know why they have to work so hard.\"-- By Sophie JeongAround Asia", "link": "https://cnn.com/2021/08/30/china/china-entertainment-crackdown-mic-intl-hnk/index.html"}, {"title": "'We are failing the elephants'", "data_published": "2016-12-12T03:55:25Z", "content": "At least thats how I remember it.

We are in the back of an open pickup near the banks of the Olifants River in South Africa.\"Drive!\" we shout at my uncle in the cab, banging on the roof.But banging on the roof is our signal to stop.The truck stops and the elephant is right behind us. We can see the milk discharging from her teats. Her newborn is somewhere hidden in the bushes.My dad pulls out an antique double-barreled shotgun. He loads it with birdshot to fire in the air.\"Dont shoot the elephant,\" my gran cries and smacks him.It would be like shooting an elephant with a tic-tac.I am crying, and so is my cousin. We smell the elephant musk; we can see the horizon through its legs.My uncle sees the elephant looming in his rearview mirror. He hits the accelerator.Outrunning the charging animal, we bounce along the dirt track. Shortly after, she turns back.We are safe. Right around the corner, the trucks axle breaks in an aardvark hole.My family often recounts this story. And from that incident, I learned elephants had to be respected -- even feared.It means no worriesImagine my alarm, then, nearly 30 years later, when I am assigned by CNN to a story in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.The guide drives right up to a breeding herd of elephants in the grasslands and promptly switches off the engine.\"Shouldnt we keep it on,\" I say, \"and maybe not be so close.\"\"The elephants here are relaxed,\" he smiles, \"Hakuna Matata.\"Meaning: \"No worries.\"I cant understand it. The elephants dont charge. They do not seem agitated, as has been my experience. They completely ignore us.To be sure, elephants can be dangerous -- and sometimes deadly. But in this section of the Mara, there hasnt been hunting for decades. They are used to the tourist vehicles.The game farm from my childhood near Olifants bordered a hunting reserve to the west. At the time, they still culled elephants in Kruger National Park to the east.The elephants knew.\"Elephants have a cognitive sense of where they are safe and where they are at risk,\" Mike Chase, the lead scientist on the Great Elephant Census, told me on a recent trip to Botswana, where hes been tracking elephant movements for years. The census is a pioneering pan-African aerial survey that aims to count the continents savanna elephant populations.\"This is really the front line, this is as far as they come, they will no longer move across eastern Namibia into Angola and Zambia, fearful of the consequences of poaching,\" says Chase.As poaching rises, the elephants know to stay away.And they remember.No, they dont forgetIts sometimes tempting to anthropomorphize -- to give an animal human characteristics -- but the more I speak to people about elephants, the more elephants seem special.I met up with Chase with Ingrid Formanek, one of CNNs most experienced field producers.Ingrids connection to Botswana runs deep.In 1999 she moved to Maun, on the doorstep of the Okavango Delta, to document the rehabilitation of elephants. She lived there on and off for five years.She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. Ingrid Formanek, CNNIngrid recounts the story of an elephant orphaned in the Kruger culls, called Shireni.Shirenis handler taught her a trick: to remove her handlers hat with her trunk and to put it on her own head and then to put it back on her handlers. Ingrid observed as the elephant learned the behavior.Nearly a decade later, Ingrid went back and saw Shireni.\"She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. She made the link to that time in our lives,\" says Ingrid. \"\"Shireni hadnt done that in all the interim years. I was amazed, and truth be told, flattered.\"Anybody who has studied or worked with elephants has their own stories about how sharp elephant memories are.Experts like Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has rescued hundreds of orphaned calves, talks about elephants remembering people years later, and the things that happened to them -- good and bad.Sheldrick speaks of elephants reintroduced to the wild who have returned years, sometimes decades, later for help with an injury or just to say \"hello.\"Vanishing herdsDespite their obvious emotional intelligence and survival instincts, elephants cant escape the ravages of humans.Elephants are slaughtered by poachers who seek their ivory tusks.Before European colonization, scientists believe that Africa may have held as many as 20 million elephants; by 1979 only 1.3 million remained -- and the Great Elephant Census revealed this year that things have gotten far worse.In the seven years between 2007 and 2014, numbers plummeted by at least 30%, or 144,000 elephants.As of July, Africas savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census . Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.And the specific cases are even more disturbing: In the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Mozambiques Niassa Reserve, elephant populations have plummeted by more than 75% in the past 10 years as poachers cut down family herds, according to the survey.\"When you think of how many elephants occurred in areas 10 or 20 years ago, its incredibly disheartening,\" says Chase.\"Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.\"In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe. It was part of southern Africas \"haven\" that comprises 60% of all savannah elephants counted in the census.But the ivory poaching wars, driven primarily by Asian demand, are on its doorstep.Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.

But the smell reveals the truth.A once glorious bull lies lifeless in a dry section of the Linyanti swamp in Botswana.

And it is just one of more than 20 we have counted in Linyanti in just over 48 hours.Now, with current rates of poaching, they will be wiped out from some of their range states.They could even go locally extinct, says Chase.\"Ive been asked if Im optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Africas elephants,\" he says, \"and on days like today, I feel that we are failing the elephants.\"This horrific scene could be the only way we remember them.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/12/11/world/vanishing-mckenzie-botswana-elephants/index.html"}, {"title": "Imagine a world without giraffes", "data_published": "2016-12-08T18:11:46Z", "content": "John D.

The elephant, the orangutan, certain bees, coral -- so many of the Earths mind-blowingly cool creatures face extinction risk these days. If poaching rates continue, some fear African elephants will be extinct in 20 years. Scientists worry coral reefs will mostly vanish by 2050 because humans continue pumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere, warming up the oceans and making them more acidic, and making life hard for coral.Ive spent much of 2016 reporting on the mass extinction event thats brewing all around the world for a CNN series called \"Vanishing.\" That reporting will debut on CNN International on Friday and on this website Monday morning.If theres one take-away from my travels, its this: We cant take species for granted.We too often assume theyll survive one generation to the next -- that those elephants or giraffes will be out there, somewhere.They wont. Not unless we humans drastically change our ways.In California, I met with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of Stanford Universitys Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve , and a global expert on extinction. He told me that we humans have -- at the very most -- 20 years to change the way we treat nature or we will bring about the sixth mass extinction event in the entire history of Earth. We are talking dinosaur-ending stuff here -- as in three-quarters of all known species, not just the cute and iconic ones, could vanish in a couple of centuries.Having trouble imagining that world?\"The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone,\" he said. \"That would be a very impoverished landscape.\"It certainly would.If youre not moved by that, consider the consequences for humans, too.\"We are basically annihilating the life on our planet -- and that is the only known life ... in the entire universe,\" Paul Ehrlich, also of Stanford, told me. \"Its life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here.

Some biologists think we have to set aside huge chunks of land -- 50% of the Earth, according to Harvard Universitys E.O. Wilson -- to stop the sixth extinction from occurring, or to lessen its scope.Add the population boom to this and you can see why farms are going to be a big issue this century.Finally, money. That means poaching -- illegal networks are decimating the populations of some animals, including elephants, rhinos and the pangolin . And it means thinking of nature as an endless vat of cash.\"How do we get off of treating nature as this bottomless checking account and begin to treat it as an investment account, where were living off the interest?\" Barnosky asked during our interview.Im not sure how well change. But I have to hope that understanding the scope of this crisis is part of moving toward solutions. Giraffes are constricted by human development; theyre poached for their tails, which are used as bracelets, and for their meat, according to the African Wildlife Foundation . We shouldnt see the giraffes plight as an isolated crisis. Humans are reshaping the face of Earth as never before. It happens in slow motion, making us easily distracted from the cumulative destruction one generation passes to the next. And many of us are so disconnected from nature -- we see it through car windows, from the suburbs, on safari -- that we dont realize the scope of our responsibility in this collapse.Imagine a world without giraffes.In the long term, without big changes, thats what we reasonably can expect.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/12/08/world/sutter-giraffe-extinction/index.html"}, {"title": "Listening for the amphibian apocalypse", "data_published": "2016-12-12T03:56:39Z", "content": "John D.

Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved .La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (CNN) The \"blue jeans\" frog is practically screaming to be noticed. Its head is blood red, and its legs are denim blue. It looks like its wearing jeggings. But this little critter, also known as the strawberry poison dart frog, is only about the size of a fingernail. It spends most of its time either high up in the trees in this Central American rainforest or rooting around in the gooey \"leaf litter\" of the forest floor.As such, its practically invisible.Unless you open your ears.Chit-chit-chit-chit-chit.\"It sounds like an insect. It buzzes.\"Thats Bryan Pijanowski, a \"soundscape ecologist\" from Purdue University and one of the few people paying attention to the fact that nature -- especially the amphibian part -- is growing exceptionally quiet these days. Pijanowski and collaborators from around the world have been strapping audio recorders to trees here at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The microphones look like funny little robots -- boxes with windscreen ears on each side.Researchers have installed microphone sensors in the rainforeset to listen for the sound of extinction.The equipment has a critical mission.Its listening for the sound of extinction.Have you heard it already? I ask Pijanowski.\"I think so,\" he tells me. His muted, baritone voice sounds like a public radio host sharing secrets with you in a library. \"There is evidence all around the world.\"Rapid extinctionsScientists fear Earth is on the verge of the sixth era of extinction.There have been five mass extinctions in the planets history.Biologists fear we are on the verge of -- or have already entered -- the sixth era of extinction in Earths history.If we usher in the sixth, three-quarters of all species could disappear in a couple of centuries, says Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford and author of \"Dodging Extinction: Power, Food, Money and the Future of Life on Earth.\"\"The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction,\" he told me, \"is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone.\"If you study amphibians, it can seem like that dystopian future already is here.About 10% of birds and a third of mammals are at high extinction risk.Not good.But more than 40% of amphibians are in similar straits -- making them worse off than any other vertebrate group, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Amphibians are vanishing without warning, and often without explanation.Chytrid fungus, which humans helped spread, has decimated frog populations around the world.\"In the past 30 years or so, weve seen really dramatic, really rapid extinctions for frog populations all over the world,\" says Steven Whitfield, a conservation ecologist at Zoo Miami who joined Pijanowski and me on the visit to Costa Rica this summer. \"Many of these extinctions are due to habitat loss. But other extinctions have occurred in pristine rainforests like this -- places that look healthy but the frogs are telling us theres something clearly wrong.\"Unable to see itWhitfield spent years studying frogs at this research station in this particular forest.I ask him to show me how its done.It doesnt take long to realize its not easy work. When Whitfield conducts a study, he often ropes off a small plot of land and then spends hours searching for every single frog he can find.The search begins with his ears.CNN Map\"Ill hear [a frog] call and spend half an hour or more looking into a small patch of vegetation, knowing that its right there and that I need to find it but unable to see it,\" he tells me.Whitfield is an expert at pulling frog sounds out of the EDM freak-out that is the rainforest. If youve been, then you know these places, in healthy conditions, are LOUD. I actually had a hard time falling asleep some nights in Costa Rica because it sounded (awesomely) like the forest was yelling at me; and I woke up early to screams of howler monkeys. (Fun aside: Researchers warn newcomers to always wear shoes -- because, vipers -- and to watch the trees, since the \"bullet ant,\" which delivers the worlds most painful bite, like a bullet, is all around.)Whitfields amphibian-listening powers are impressive, but even he has trouble finding frogs by sight. He takes me and a group of researchers from the Center for Global Soundscapes deep into the forest just after dusk one evening, when some frogs tend to be the most active. Our headlamps provide a washed-out sort of tunnel vision of the diversity hiding all around us.A Mexican Treefrog at La Selva Biological Station, which is a hub for field ecology.Whitfield can hear and identify frogs at great distance. Theres the \"chit-chit-chit\" of the blue jeans frog (the one with jeggings), the panicked meowing of a creature aptly nicknamed the \"kitten frog.\" He hears the slot-machine rattle of the \"glass frog,\" which has a translucent belly, allowing you to see organs through its skin. Smoky jungle frogs scream like human babies when theyre threatened, and the tink frog seems to be named for its metallic call, which sounds like that ear-piercing noise a smoke detector makes when it wants you to change its battery.This place is way beyond \"ribbit.\" The sounds are staggering.But finding these frogs by sight?Thats more difficult.In a couple of hours, we saw only a handful of frogs.Spiders almost seem easier to come by.\"Those bite,\" Whitfield says, pointing to one. \"Dont touch that.\"Something is happeningIm grateful for the research Whitfield and other field ecologists have contributed when it comes to frogs. Their diligent, painstaking, searching-through-the-leaves work is how we know important (and fun) frog facts, like that the female blue jeans frog is an amphibian supermom.A view from the forest canopy at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.Her tadpoles hatch on the forest floor, he says, but thats a precarious place for them, so she carries them, on her back, high up into the forest canopy, sometimes 10 to 15 meters off the ground -- about 33 to 50 feet. She drops the tadpoles off in little puddles of water up there in the forest canopy and makes a mental note of their location. She does this again and again, leaving her young all over the forest canopy. She remembers where all these tadpoles are (!!) and spends her days climbing the trees to deliver food.\"Thats pretty complicated behavior for a tiny little frog,\" Whitfield says.His research also has helped show that frogs at La Selva are in decline.\"We have really good long-term data on whats been happening with frog populations over four decades,\" he tells me. \"In the forest here now, theres only about 25% as many frogs as there were sustained throughout the 1970s. And for us, thats a concern because it says that something is happening to this rainforest but we dont fully understand what that is.\"The strawberry poison dart frog is sometimes called the blue jeans frog.Thats worth stating again.Locally, only a quarter of the frogs from the 1970s remain.Meanwhile, the human population jumped from less than 4 billion to 7.4 billion today.Whitfields search-the-forest work is critical.But even he would say it could use a technological assist.Thats where Pijanowski and his tree-hugging microphones come in.Hes listening for changes Whitfield might not be able to see.Your ears ringBryan Pijanowski is an ecologist by training. Before that, he was a \"quiet alterboy-ish kind of kid\" in the Midwest who also was sort of an audiophile -- and an amateur musician. He played guitar in a high school band called Destruction. \"Everybody wanted you to play Freebird,\" he said, \"so thats what I played -- over and over again.\"In school, he set out to become a medical doctor but changed his mind after hearing the \"dawn chorus\" of a swamp in Michigan. He became obsessed with nature and its music.Bryan Pijanowski is a \"soundscape ecologist\" from Purdue University. Hes also director of the Center for Global Soundscapes.So he studied birds and ecology, and eventually turned to \"soundscapes,\" the emerging field of using sound to understand the shifts in the health and function of ecosystems.The work makes him so sound-focused he now has to wear earplugs to sleep.He cant stop listening.\"There are times when [the rainforest] is almost too loud,\" he tells me.\"Its like being too close to the speakers at a concert. Your ears ring.\"La Selva is now one of his study sites. Hes working to develop others around the world, including underwater to listen for changes to coral reefs. His microphones have taken him to the tip of South America and the deserts of Mongolia. But this site is special both because the rainforest is nearly untouched -- and because theres so much data. Pijanowski got his hands on recordings that date back to 2008 and started making his own recordings here in 2010. At the peak of his research, hed installed 34 microphone sensors.Now he has 255,000 recordings here, totaling about 6.8 years of tape.Hes still analyzing the data with the help of computer algorithms.What hes heard -- or rather, what he doesnt hear -- definitely freaks him out.Acoustic fossilsOne evening, insects and frogs chattering outside, Pijanowski sits me down in an open-window classroom at the research station and shows me some of his sound files.He visualizes the audio in charts called spectrograms.These charts illuminate trends that a walk through the forest cant.Take a look at this La Selva recording from 2008.And then another from 2015, recorded under similar conditions.Hear the difference?Those are just two moments.Pijanowskis team can compress a years worth of sound into one chart.Take a look at what happens when you look at those years side by side. The red parts of the charts indicate more audible activity. The main frog frequencies grow much bluer, and quieter.A year of audio is compressed into spectrograms. Red indicates more sound coming from the forest. Blue is much quieter.Its too soon to draw scientific conclusions from this, Pijanowski tells me.But hes frightened.\"Im worried that these would potentially become acoustic fossils,\" he says.\"In other words, the animals that are in these files are no longer alive. And the only record that we have of some of their presence is in an audio recording.\"That is somewhat disturbing to me, as a scientist and also as a citizen of this planet.\"A collaborator of Pijanowskis, Michael Towsey, tells me he has a file of an Australian frog thats thought to be extinct -- a recording that already is an acoustic fossil.You can listen to that frogs call here on the Internet.But you can no longer hear it in nature.Most beautiful sound in the worldWhy does this matter?Theres the self-interested argument.Heres Steven Whitfields take on that.\"We are all dependent on the planet for clean water, for oxygen. And ecosystems not only provide food to people but rainforests like this are an important source of medicines. Some of the frogs that live in the rainforest here have chemicals in their skin that have been found to be important medicines. They can be painkillers or heart medicines. So these are things that can be really useful for medicine. And wed like to not lose those. If we do lose those, it hurts us all.\"Frog populations at La Selva Biological Station have plunged 75% since the 1970s, according to Steven Whitfield, Zoo Miami.Theres the ecosystem collapse argument.Bryan Pijanowski: \"Some of the theoretical work that were doing and ecology suggests that we could have ecosystem collapse. And thats not good ... You dont wanna start removing organisms and expect the ecosystem to survive and function in a healthy way. It could very well mean that some of the things that we are much more emotionally attached to are lost.\"That should be enough to sway a pragmatist.Still, I think theres a more human reason you should care about the disappearance of amphibians.Chances are you never or rarely see frogs in your day-to-day life. But when you learn about them -- those with translucent bellies, supermom instincts, blue-jean legs and poisonous skin, all of which are calling to be noticed by each other if not by us -- then its hard to ignore their plight.There are multiple causes of the amphibian apocalypse, but all the trouble points back to us. Weve helped carry a killer fungus, called chytrid, around the globe, with disastrous consequences. Climate change has been implicated in frog die-offs. Pollution is a big problem since frogs live part-time in water and basically breathe through their skin.They are the front lines -- the most vulnerable of species.Yet few of us seem truly outraged by their disappearance.Maybe that will change if we start listening more closely.After all, frog choruses are some of the most fascinating songs in nature.One recording from the island of Borneo -- called \"dusk by the frog pond\" -- was voted by the always-wise Internet as \"the most beautiful sound in the world.\"Its not too late to stop the sixth extinction from taking permanent hold of us, according to Barnosky, the Stanford researcher. We have at most 20 years to change our ways.Theres hope. But we must ditch fossil fuels, mitigating climate change. We have to stop the spread of invasive species and disease. And, in the view of one prominent biologist, we must set aside half the planet for the benefit of biodiversity and nature.Otherwise, we risk silencing the frogs.And perhaps the rest of nature, too.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/12/11/world/vanishing-sutter-amphibian-extinction/index.html"}, {"title": "When the coral disappears, so will they", "data_published": "2016-12-12T03:59:29Z", "content": "John D.

This story is part of a CNN series called \" Vanishing .\" Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.Nosy Andragnombala, Madagascar (CNN) Its 2 a.m. when the half-moon wakes Hary. He senses its gravitational pull -- feels the moon coaxing fish out of a nearby reef and into his fishing nets here at the edge of Africa.The 33-year-old fisherman seems to have an almost-telepathic relationship with the coral that surround this castaway island, which is little more than a heap of sand off the southwest coast of Madagascar. That relationship was passed down from his father, and its one held by Vezo people here.That word -- Vezo -- is taken to mean \"at struggle with the sea,\" and residents of Nosy Andragnombala define themselves by that struggle. At birth, their umbilical cords are placed in seashells and tossed as an offering into deep blue waters.They are part of the reef, and it is part of them.Theres little else: No electricity or freshwater. No industry, no jobs, no school. If you dont know the reef -- cant feel its tides and sense its moods -- then you cant survive.And that makes whats happening on this island all the more tragic.The reef is disappearing.Coral have started turning white and dying. No one here understands why.Local theories abound. Was it that hurricane? A chemical spill? A curse? Moake, an older neighbor of Harys, told me white coral snagged his fishing net one day. It spooked him, and now he wont return to that spot. \"Ive already seen the white coral but I dont know whats caused it to become white,\" Hary tells me. \"I dont know whether its something in the water thats caused it to turn white.\"Hary wakes well before dawn to cast fishing nets into the Mozambique Channel.Yet, hes seen clues.\"Theres a time when you see it,\" he says. \"During the hot season.\"Scientists can explain the mystery of the white coral.But, frankly, Im starting to see it as a curse, too.A curse you and I cooked up.And then we weptBy now, the storyline should be familiar: We humans are burning loads of fossil fuels and chopping down the rainforest, and thats causing the atmosphere to heat up rapidly.Thats true regardless of whos in the White House.Whats less understood is that the ocean is actually storing much of that heat.Beneath the surface, theres evidence of a mass extinction brewing.Coral are among the silent victims, and the results are undeniable.This year, amid record heat, 93% of the Great Barrier Reef experienced bleaching , the term used to describe sick coral that eject the bright-colored algae that live on them. Bleached coral turn white, and while theyre not dead, they are suffocating. The colorful algae feed the coral with the oxygen and sugar they need to survive. With prolonged or repeated bleaching, coral begin to die, eventually turning to rubble or becoming smothered by plants. It doesnt help that adding CO2 to the atmosphere and ocean also makes the waters more acidic, and worse still for the survival of coral.CNN MapThe consequences are truly stunning.Research indicates nearly all the worlds coral reefs could be lost by 2050.This is just one sign of the sweeping changes we humans are inflicting on the natural world, and ultimately on ourselves. Biologists say we are on the verge of the Earths sixth mass-extinction event -- something akin to the end of the dinosaurs. Anthony Barnosky, a researcher at Stanford, told me we have perhaps 20 years to change course -- including addressing climate change -- or three-quarters of the worlds species could vanish in coming centuries.Overfishing and pollution also threaten coral in Madagascar. But climate change -- and the warming and ocean acidification that come with it -- is expected to land the soundest blow.To stop that, we need to eliminate net carbon pollution.Basically, that means purging fossil fuels from the global economy.If we fail, there will be dire consequences.Journalists often see the end of coral through the eyes of scientists. \"I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept,\" Terry Hughes, a professor at Australias James Cook University, wrote on Twitter in April.Or we focus on losses for the tourism industry, which could be considerable.Those perspectives matter.More critical, though, are the 275 million people who depend on coral reefs for survival.Hary and Lydia are raising six children. They cant afford to send them to school.Theyre people like Hary, his wife, Lydia, and the six children theyre raising.Their fates are linked to a catastrophe we are helping to cause.My children cant eatHary stops by my tent on his midnight walk to the ocean.\"Ooh-OOH! Ooh-OOH!\" he calls.Translation: Get up, reporter dude. The fish are waiting.I stumble out of my sleeping bag, groggy and confused. Soon, we push off into the darkness of the Mozambique Channel in an outrigger canoe that Hary built by hand. Hary is in the back; the butt cheeks of his shorts are patched from years spent perched on the rails of the narrow boat. His second eldest son, Harizo, is up front. The 13-year-old is his dads professional shadow.A blood-colored moon hangs on the southern horizon. Father and son are faint silhouettes against the midnight sky and charcoal sea. The air tastes of salt, and the lull of the waves feels almost womb-like. Most surreal: The waters are bioluminescent, so each stroke of the paddle causes twinkling constellations of light to swim across the reef below us, as if mirroring the stars. The scene is exhilarating, especially for a city dweller like me.In this moment I understand how completely tied Hary is to waters around the island.As we paddle away from shore, sea melting into the distant horizon, I think about the disaster unfolding below the hull of the boat: The reef already is dying.If we dont find anything out there, my children cant eat. Lydia, Nosy AndragnambalaA local nonprofit called Blue Ventures has been doing scuba surveys of reef health in this area. Their divers found 70% of reefs were bleached in April, at the peak of a heatwave, which is attributed partly to El Niño but also to the warming trend were causing by burning fossil fuels.Hary and the other fishermen know their catch is a fraction of what it once was.\"We really suffer when we go a week without catching anything,\" he says.Their children cry from hunger, his wife, Lydia, tells me.\"If we dont find anything out there,\" she says, \"my children cant eat.\"Ways of the seaHary and Lydias response to the crisis? Try harder.Theyre nothing if not resourceful.They moved to this island years ago because the reef on mainland Madagascar was too degraded -- and because the fishing was farther away. Hary lived out here with his father as a boy, and Lydia later joined him. Theyd known each other as little kids in school. Neither was able to finish, though. They had to fish.They have four kids together and care for at least two others; one is the son of a relative who died. The village is home to a few dozen people, and many depend, at least in part, on Harys catch for their own survival.Out here, people have to work together to make it.After putting his net in the water about 3 a.m. Hary makes it back at shore by about 5 a.m. He is out again at dawn to collect his nets, and then spends the afternoon on the water, casting a long line with 50 hooks on it into the deep ocean just beyond the barrier of the reef.In all, he spends about 12 hours per day at sea.Lydia and the kids are hard at work, too. If you walk around Nosy Andragnombala, youre sure to see tiny children building and playing with wooden toy boats. They whittle out the hull and mast and then attach scrap-plastic sails. The kids push these little boats out onto the waves, tapping them with sticks so they catch the wind just so. When the children are about 10 years old, Hary says, theyll be ready to fish out on the water. He wont need to teach them to sail, though. Theyll already understand how wind and wood work together.Lydia searches reef flats near the island for octopus.Like other women on the island, Lydia hunts octopus and cooks. At dusk, she boils fish on a fire while the sun sets and humpback whales perform their lumbering acrobatics on the horizon.Its an idyllic place, but the struggle to live here is real. Several years ago, locals created an ocean reserve to protect the reef. They work with a village association to police the waters. Those efforts, combined with an intimate knowledge of the reef, make survival possible.But barely.One day, Lydia asks me, though an interpreter, if I want her to \"teach me the ways of the sea.\"I do, of course.I slap some $12-a-bottle sunscreen on my face, and she leads me onto the ankle-deep reef flats, a spear in her hand and a notebook in mine.Hara, John!Lydia is a woman defined by brightness. Her shirt is magenta, yellow and blue. Her smile is loud and infectious, and she paints her face with a paste of mashed-up mangrove seeds, turning it orange and protecting it from the sun. Her intellect shines, too. If you duck down and follow her into her home, whose footprint is about the size of three queen mattresses and often sleeps eight, youll notice two pieces of butcher paper pinned to the thatched walls. On them: English words translated into phonetics and then into Vezo, the local language.\"Water = oatere = rano.\"\"Fish = fise = fia.\"\"This is our octopus reserve = Dise ize ore aketapose rezeriva = Ato misy ty rezeriva horita nay.\"She has been learning English in case a visitor showed up someday.\"Photo, John! Photo!\"Lydia points at a black urchin in the ankle-deep water. Each time she sees something new -- especially spiky, dont-step-on-that stuff, like an urchin -- she gestures frantically and insists I take a photo and write down the Vezo word for the creature in my notebook.\"John, photo!\" A round, pink urchin.\"Photo!\" Some greenish blob that apparently will kill you.\"Horita!\"Thats an octopus, which she identifies by noticing the way the creature has arranged a pile of rocks, just so, in front of its secret den. The spot is completely unremarkable to me until she dips her spear into the hole and then twists it gently, like a baker rolling bread sticks. A tentacle emerges and wraps itself around the stick. Lydia pulls the creature out, notes that it is large enough to harvest sustainably (she wont take small octopuses because she worries about depleting the reef; and the community has established its own reef management system to try to protect its natural resources) and then stabs the tip of the spear through its Jell-O head.A black ink cloud puddles in the water.She ties the octopus to a bright blue string and drags it like a rag doll.The tour continues.Local coral is damaged for many reasons, but climate change could deliver the knock-out punch.\"Hara, John!\"Hara means coral.Lydia points at one piece of healthy coral in a mess of rubble, a vast expanse of reef that looks something like the ruins of an ancient city. It stretches on like almost as far as I can see, a few live coral here and there, but mostly khaki, beige and gray.It is heartbreaking to see this rubble.Especially juxtaposed against her enthusiasm.Dont touch itI struggle with whether or how to engage Hary and Lydia in a conversation about climate change and the white coral -- this foreign curse that understandably makes little sense out here.How do you tell someone that factories and cars and deforestation on the other side of the world are slowly heating up the entire planet, warming the ocean, making it more acidic, and messing up reefs worldwide? Its a tricky concept even for those of us who are climate culprits, who live in polluted cities and burn coal to pump electricity and air conditioning into our homes.Out here, there are no factories, no air pollution, no cars or roads. Lydia says shes only been in a car once in her life, and it was to take her son to another family members funeral. Her son cried, she says, because he didnt understand what was happening. Only one or two cell phones (solar powered) exist on the island, and theres a single dusty television set. Its owner uses it mostly to play Kung Fu movies from a USB stick for the islands kids.Yet, this is an existential crisis.To be Vezo, according to some, you have to work on the water.This place -- and its culture -- could vanish with the reef.I ask James Paul, a diver who surveys reefs in this area for Blue Ventures, and is Vezo himself, how he handles local conversations about climate change.Its difficult, he says.\"I tell them just be careful, its sick. Dont touch it. If you touch it, its dead quick.\"Of course, there are solutions.But if youre on an island with essentially no carbon footprint there isnt much you can do to prevent global warming -- aside from sharing your story.Their only real hope is for us to listen.Were as good as deadI invite Lydia to sit down on a sand dune to talk about all this.I feel like the prophet of doom.I tell her that people like me on the other side of the world -- people who are addicted to dirty energy sources, like coal and oil, and who drive around in cars and make things in factories that billow black smoke -- have a hand in turning the coral here white.Lydia is a master at finding and identifying ocean creatures.Yes, there are local problems contributing to problems with the coral. The cyclone that almost killed her son destroyed some coral, and overfishing plays a role. But scientists say people like me must change or coral reefs all over the world -- not just here -- will disappear.She stares at me -- more in disbelief than anger.Then she laughs, seemingly to cover the discomfort.\"Were as good as dead,\" she says.\"Therell be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white.\"\"It scares me, people far away are causing this,\" she adds, rightly. \"Its like theyre the ones sending us this heat, which is destroying the coral. So what happens if theres something else they do or make that causes death here?\"She worries about her children. Before Harys mother died two years ago, some of her kids lived with their grandmother on the mainland so they could attend classes. But after she died the family couldnt afford it, she tells me, so they had to come back to the island. ( School, by the way, costs only $3 per month per child , but the family earns too little.) She wants her children to grow up Vezo -- to know the ocean -- but she also wants them to have options.Without an education, what other career options will they have?What happens to them if all the coral turns white?She turns to our translator and asks a question about me and a CNN videographer.\"So when they go back home, theyll teach people what theyve learned here? Theyll tell people about what theyve seen? Theyll tell people this is what life is like in Madagascar?\"She trails off.\"Maybe there are just too many cars where theyre from.\"I tell her the reason Ive come is to tell her story. And that yes, I hope that when people turn on their lights or start their cars or get on airplanes (or, most importantly, vote for public officials who care about this) that they will think about a tiny island in Madagascar.About people whose lives are threatened by the curse of the white coral.But, secretly, I worry about those of us causing the curse.Will we actually care enough to stop?Side to sideThe night after that conversation I wake up with a piercing headache.Id been dreaming about swimming down a pristine canal that suddenly turns into an industrial wasteland.Blue water turns brown and smells of gasoline.Smoke fills the air.Nosy Andragnambala is located off the coast of Madagascar, a large island nation in eastern Africa.When I awake, I realize the smell of gas is real. I unzip the tent and walk into a stiff wind, toward the beach. The horizon glimmers the color of peach, the first sign of dawn.Where is that smell coming from? I can almost taste the tang of gasoline in my mouth. But how can that be? There are no motors on the island.Then I see it.Our boat, with its 25-horsepower Yamaha engine.We used the motor to cut across the Mozambique Channel to this island in an hour, as opposed to the three or four or five needed to cross by sail. The irony didnt hit me at the time. I figured we would need the motorboat to maximize the reporting wed do.Were as good as dead. Therell be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white. Lydia, Nosy AndragnambalaWe make these choices by default. Too often, we dont see them or smell them -- dont actually feel the results of our actions. Thats particularly true of climate change, since the effects are both diffuse and long term. Our actions now determine the type of world Lydias great-great-great-great-great grandchildren will inherit. Climate change is sinister that way.There are signs of progress.Were moving into the clean-energy era. Technology is helping.But all this is happening at a glacial pace.And it doesnt help that US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the Paris Agreement, which aims to get the world to ditch fossil fuels and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius.Will we do enough to save the coral -- and so many other species?We depend on them more than we know.I walk around the boat to get some fresh air, blowing in straight from the sea.I sit down to watch the sunrise. A flock of birds hold formation in the wind. Crabs with little telescoping eyes skitter side to side in the sand. A hunk of dead coral is at my feet.We are scheduled to leave Nosy Andragnombala in a day.The scent of gasoline will evaporate then.But our mark remains.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/12/11/world/vanishing-sutter-coral-madagascar/index.html"}, {"title": "The old man and the bee", "data_published": "2016-12-12T03:59:54Z", "content": "John D.

He hadnt seen the bee -- no one had seen this particular bee species -- in 10 years when he asked me to join him.It was August, the last breath of summer bee season. Robbin Thorp, then 82, a retired entomologist from University of California-Davis, wore a safari hat, tinted bifocals and a T-shirt with an image of Franklins bumblebee printed on the chest. That black-and-yellow bee, which looks like so many others except for the characteristic \"U\" on its back, is the object of Thorps obsession. Its a creature he told me flies through his dreams, always just out of reach.Finding it -- believing it can be found -- is what brings him to this spot 6,400 feet above sea level, near the base of a ski lift, even though his gait is wobbly now and these craggy, alpine ravines could break a 20-something hip.Franklins bumblebee is a species other scientists fear extinct. But Thorp will barely entertain that idea.\"When things are rare, theyre really, really hard to find,\" he told me.Thorp can be matter of fact like that.And so the old man keeps looking, bee net in one hand and \"bee vacuum\" in the other. He walks from one flower to the next, inspecting the pollinators. If he sees one that might be Franklins hell slurp it into the bee vacuum, which looks like a childs water gun. Then he closely inspects it: \"Just another one of the common bumblebees.\"He does this on his own time and for no pay, usually alone.Day after day, year after year.Its almost like something out of Hemingway: The old man and the bee.Ill admit that when I met Thorp on August 8, 2016, the day before the 10-year anniversary of his last sighting of Franklins bumblebee, which occurred on that very slope, I had my doubts about his quest. To me, the bee hunt seemed like a Sisyphean task. Thats because scientists say we are entering a new age of mass extinction. Species are disappearing at something like 100 times the normal rate, and biologists fear three-quarters of all species could disappear in the next couple centuries if we dont stop polluting the atmosphere and bulldozing habitat.In that context, its hard not to see Thorp as an old man living in an old world, one where a species reasonably can be expected to survive one year to the next.We dont live in that world anymore.But after two days with Thorp I realized that hes on to something.Its precisely when we stop looking for species that we allow them to vanish.WOAHDUDEIm sure by now youve read something about bees being in trouble. Maybe youve heard of \"colony collapse disorder,\" or perhaps theres a do-gooder on your Facebook page who is raising a beehive in her yard and takes way too many selfies in a Space-Age suit.All of that barely scratches the surface of the trouble bees face.There are roughly 20,000 species of bees in the world -- thats more than birds or amphibians or reptiles or mammals -- and the Western honey bee, the one you usually hear about, the one that lives in big, social hives and is domesticated to produce honey -- is just one of those species.To get a sense of what the other 19,999 are like, it helps to talk to Sam Droege, a researcher at the US Geological Surveys Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab in Maryland. Droege spends his days taking super-high-resolution photos of dead bee specimens, some of which come from natural history museums and others that are pulled from field research. One benefit of the work is that it provides a detailed catalog of species, in case they disappear.But the photos are also just really freaking cool -- in that way potheads can appreciate. Some of the images first got popular on a stoner-themed subpage of the website reddit. The page is called \"WOAHDUDE.\" Droeges daughter brought that to his attention, \"Why was my daughter looking at the stoner subreddit, I dont know!,\" he told a documentary film crewTake a look at a few of the images:Photos: The amazing diversity of wild bees There are an estimated 20,000 bee species worldwide, including those with green and blue bodies.

Hide Caption 14 of 14Were losing this diversity fast.So thats the stoner argument for why bees matter.Heres the self-interested one: Bees help pollinate 35% of the worlds food, and bumblebees, of which Franklins bumblebee is (or was) one, pollinate everything from tomatoes to cranberries and blueberries and melons. Yet they live in underground colonies, caring for a queen. And they dont make honey, so you dont hear as much about them from journalists.Sarina Jepsen, deputy chair of the International Union for Conservation of Natures bumblebee specialist group, and a director at the Xerces Society, an environmental nonprofit, told me about 25% of bumblebees in North America are at risk for extinction. \"If you think about it, thats a really strikingly high percentage of a fauna to be declining -- and in some cases really crashing,\" said Leif Richardson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics.And much of the vanishing is undocumented.\"Its abysmal what we know right now,\" Droege, from USGS, told me.\"There are just too few people on the ground looking.\"It was just goneRobbin Thorp started looking for Franklins bumblebee in the 1960s. Hed taken an entomology course at the University of Michigan and got hooked on the invisible insect world. Its an obsession that was, from the start, both personal and professional. He told me his first wife did not love the fact that he kept stacks of insect eggs and other specimens in their apartment.\"She was not a naturalist,\" he said, laughing. \"But she put up with it.\"In 1998, he began to study Franklins bumblebee in earnest.In part, he was interested in whether the bee should be listed under the Endangered Species Act. But he also just wanted to know what this bee was all about. Why did it live only in northern California and southern Oregon when so many other bee species had wider ranges? Which flowers did it prefer? Which plants and potentially crops would be lost without it?Back then, the bee was relatively abundant -- not the most common, but far from the least. \"I could walk down and see (Franklins bumblebee) on every patch of flowers,\" he told me.\"Id see 15, 20 of em in just a short distance.\"A year or two later, the bee became more difficult to find.Then all of a sudden: \"It was just gone.\"Thorps work shifted from what-is-this-bee-up-to to where-the-hell-did-it-go. The bee scientist, in a sense, became a detective. Who or what could have killed Franklins bumblebee?Thorp hoped finding it might offer some clues.Theres something flying!I met Thorp on a cool, clear morning in the parking lot at the base of Oregons Mount Ashland Ski Area. You could see Californias Mount Shasta from this altitude. I worry about meeting people for the first time -- whether Ill know who they are and all that. But identifying Thorp was no trouble at all. White truck, bumblebee sticker on tailgate. Yep, thats him.His treasured bee, however, proved much harder to pick out of a crowd.We drove 15 minutes or so down a gravel road toward the meadow where Thorp last spotted Franklins bumblebee, on August 9, 2006, a date he recites from memory. When we stopped, Thorp pulled a little wooden box out of the back of his pickup and opened it.Inside, rows of dead bees with pins stuck through them.\"These are Franklins,\" he said, pointing to three of them. \"A queen, a worker and a male.\"Shaky handwriting dated the specimens: \"1950.\"The trouble: Franklins bee looked like so many others in the box. Thorp told me Franklins is distinguished by its \"round black face\" -- \"some of the others have a very long face,\" he said -- and by a U-shaped black marking on its back, near the wings. \"Youre going to be seeing a lot of these,\" Thorp said, pointing to the Yellow-Faced Bumblebee, which, true to name, has a yellow face (as does Franklins) and a distinguishing yellow stripe on its abdomen.None of this helped me much. I drew a few pictures in my notebook -- jotted down these descriptions and pretended I could tell all of these seemingly identical bees apart.\"Theres something flying!\" Thorp said, pointing to a bee that buzzed right by my leg.\"Its probably headed for the flowers.\"Apparently, so were we.Thats a flyTo find bees, Thorp told me, you start with the flowers.If you know something about bumblebees and what theyre up to -- I didnt, Thorp did -- this makes sense. Bumblebees serve a queen, which is buried in a den beneath the ground. Worker bees -- females that dont reproduce because theyre not the queen -- fly around during the day collecting flower pollen and nectar for food and energy.They carry the pollen back to the nest in saddle bags, which look like little orange or yellow (it depends on the pollen) footballs taped to their legs. I asked Thorp if this was the origin of the phrase \"the bees knees.\" Sorry to report: Its not. He did tell me, however, that all of these bumblebees, except the queen, die each year. The queen hibernates through the winter alone, producing the next years generation.Its a risky life cycle, and its one reason Thorp is so concerned about Franklins, which, by the way, is named for a researcher, not Benjamin Franklin.Another fun bumblebee fact: Females sting, males dont.To prove the point, Thorp slurped a male from the air with his bee vacuum --ZEEEEEEEEP!-- and put the poor guy in my hand.\"Its kind of like a cell phone on buzz mode,\" he said.Thats exactly how it felt.That buzz -- which is much stronger on a bumblebee than other bees -- is what shakes pollen off of flowers, helping them reproduce. Bumblebees pollinate crops other bees cant.Some bees have evolved to pollinate very-specific plants. Franklins bumblebee can pollinate many things, Thorp told me, but it tends to prefer two plants: a mini-mum-looking flower called yellow buckwheat; and a purplish blossom commonly called coyote mint, but which Thorp calls \"monardella.\" We set our sights on those flowers and continued scanning the field.The trouble: These flowers were everywhere.Notebook in hand, I started testing my bee-ID skills.I pointed at a bee I thought, stupidly, might be Franklins.\"This also has a yellow face but its shaggier looking,\" he said.Id never thought of bees as \"shaggy\" before.\"Which one is that?\" I asked.\"Thats a fly.\"500 million butterfliesThe precise location where Thorp saw Franklins bumblebee in 2006 is on a steep slope, past a clump of trees and slightly below the Pacific Crest Trail, the famous hiking path.Unlike me, Thorp can identify bees in a split second. He knew instantly that this was Franklins bumblebee, which he hadnt seen in three years at that point. He saw it zip down the meadow, across what now is a field of yellow buckwheat, and toward a soggy ravine.Thorp was 72 then.Still, he ran downhill after the bee.He never caught it.And he remains mystified by its disappearance.Thats because the usual bee killers dont make total sense for Franklins.There are a number of reasons for the crash of pollinators bees worldwide. Mainly, they are habitat loss ( nearly 40% of all land is used for agriculture , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization), climate change (the land thats left is changing, and this is shrinking the ranges of some bees) and rampant chemical use.You may remember seeing images of millions of dead bees in South Carolina earlier this year. Officials sprayed insecticide in hopes of killing mosquitoes that could transmit the Zika virus. Millions of honeybees became unintended casualties. More pervasive, though, are pesticides and herbicides, which are routinely sprayed on crops like corn. More than 500 million monarch butterflies have disappeared since 1997 , according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Thats partly because herbicide use has killed off much of their habitat, the group says, noting that a Texas sized chunk of monarch habitat has been lost in the last 20 years.Some researchers fear their epic migration is in jeopardy.Franklins bumblebee, meanwhile, seems to live on a pristine, alpine meadow, with few people around and no crops that I saw. Its historic range only includes California and Oregon. Climate change is mangling so many things in the natural world its difficult to tease out its effect everywhere -- but Thorp suspected a totally different culprit.To understand it, you need to take a quick trip with me.Caution: Bumblebees at workTheres a shiny pool of disinfectant by the door to the greenhouse at Windset Farms in British Columbia, about 600 miles up the Pacific Coast from Mount Ashland.Two ominous signs are stuck to the door.\"Warning: Strict biosecurity measures in effect.\"\"Caution: Bumblebees at work.\"I got a tour from Ron Moes, a senior grower at Windset, which grows tomatoes and a host of other crops in greenhouses that seem big enough to contain neighborhoods.I was interested in the farm because it hires commercial bees -- raised in factories some 2,000 miles away and then flown way out here.\"When we get the bees, they come in a box like this,\" Moes told me, pointing to what looked to be a box for legal files. Except that it had a bunch of bees buzzing around inside.\"When I started, we pollinated everything by hand,\" he said. \"We manually went around with the -- we call it a vibrator -- and we would touch every flower and pollinate.\" Now that the greenhouse has hired commercial bees, an industry that developed in the late 1990s, the process is more efficient and cheaper. \"Theyre great workers,\" Moes said. \"They put in a lot of time. They basically go from sunup to sunset, and they basically work seven days a week.\"Aside from the postapocalyptic feel of the place -- the bees are raised only for mass production and their colonies are incinerated after eight weeks of work -- perhaps there is nothing wrong with hiring bees for their pollination services. They can pollinate better than a \"vibrator\" -- so let them do their thing, right? But Thorp and other researchers are concerned about diseases that can spread anytime you have a bunch of homogenous livestock -- or bees -- in one place.Thorp fears greenhouse diseases, perhaps one called Nosema, infected wild bee populations -- and helped lead to the rapid decline of Franklins bumblebee.Moes told me Windset takes ample precautions to prevent that sort of thing from happening. Aside from incinerating the hives, they trap queen bees inside the boxes permanently so that she cant start new colonies. The greenhouse is disinfected regularly, he said.Still, there are open panels in the ceiling of the greenhouse. And while Moes told me these bees have no interest in leaving so many pollination-ready tomato crops, it does seem possible one or two could sneak out. Its enough of a concern that conservationists like Jepsen, at the Xerces Society in Portland, want stiffer, disease-minded regulation of the commercial bee industry. She also wants commercial bees to only be local species, instead of shipped around the globe.Whats the value of this?Whatever the cause, Thorp is understandably alarmed by Franklins bumblebees disappearance. And hes sure humans are behind it somehow.As I walked up and down the meadows of Oregon with Thorp looking for this impossible-to-find insect, I thought about how we know so very little about the natural world. We live in concrete cities, deal only with managed forms of nature -- farms, lawns, medians.In a generation or two, will there be any Robbin Thorps left?Will anyone notice species like Franklins are disappearing?Maybe it seems like this doesnt matter -- its just one bee. Others will pick up the slack of pollinating wildflowers, and we have factory bees to pollinate fruits and vegetables now.To that, Id offer two arguments.One is that farmers in part of China now have to pollinate apple crops by hand because wild bee populations have vanished entirely. True, the crop isnt gone. But what does that say about us?For the second, Ill give the floor to Thorp.I asked him to name the question about Franklins that bothers him most.\"I guess the question that irks me the most is, Whats the value of this?\"Meaning, whats the economic value of this species.He hates that question because, yes, pollination services from nature are valued at billions per year, and, yes, the grocery store would look much sadder without bees and other pollinators.But thats missing the bigger truth.\"I dont think you can put an economic value on a species,\" he told me, sitting in that meadow in Oregon hes returned to so many times since 2006. \"To me theyre all valuable. Theyre all priceless really ... Franklins is one that Ive had a lot of personal investment in, in many ways. And, yeah, I feel an attachment and kinship to it.\"Can you imagine what the world would be like if we all thought that way?We might not be on the verge of the sixth mass extinction in Earths history -- something of dinosaur-ending magnitude. Anthony Barnosky, an expert on this from Stanford University, told me humans have about 20 years max to shape up before this mass extinction becomes inevitable. And by mass extinction he means three-quarters of all known species would be lost.Franklins bumblebee should be a wake-up call -- a window into a dystopian future.It certainly was for me.Honeybee on buckwheatI wasted the first day-and-a-half I spent with Thorp wondering what keeps this old man looking for this lost bee. It must be extinct, I thought. Give up.But then, somehow, I got hooked on this quest.The more I looked for Franklins bumblebee, the more I learned about this meadow in Oregon, the rich lattice of flowers, bees, ferns and the like that make it wonderful and unique. And the more I learned the more I wanted to believe that Franklins bumblebee might still be out there -- somewhere, against all odds.I know that probably sounds silly, but Thorps endless vat of hope is infectious. If were going to beat the sixth extinction, we have to believe its possible. We need to believe species like Franklins bumblebee matter.We should be pissed off theyre missing.Late in the afternoon, I left Thorp and walked off on my own path.Thorp mutters notes into a voice recorder while he walks through the mountains looking for bees -- listing the flowers and the insects. I decided to try the same, speaking notes to my phone.\"Honeybee on buckwheat. Yellow-faced whatever on buckwheat.\"\"Theres a big patch of this mint stuff that Franklins bumblebee likes. Its kinda purple. Yellow faced bumblebee -- looks like -- just flew up. Its buzzing one of those flowers. I guess its good there are bees here at all, but these are NOT the bees Im looking for.\"\"Theres just this buzzing sound all around you. It kinda makes you insane.\"I got so into it that I actually started talking to the bees.\"Do you guys know where Franklin is?\"We never found it.I was crushed.Thorp was disappointed but hopeful.And as long as he can walk, he told me, he will continue the search.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/12/11/us/vanishing-sutter-franklins-bumblebee/index.html"}, {"title": "Sixth extinction: 20 years to stop ecological collapse", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights John Sutter: The Earths next mass extinction -- the first caused by people -- is on the horizon Three-fourths of species could vanish, unless we take preventive steps, he saysEditor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.CNN —The Earth’s next mass extinction – the first caused by people – is on the horizon. And the consequences are almost unthinkably dire: Three-quarters of species could disappear.This has happened only five times in the planet’s history – including the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs.What’s different now is that humans are causing these changes.How? Well, we’re burning fossil fuels and consequently heating up the planet; turning massive chunks of land into farms; spreading invasive species and diseases around the world; boosting our own numbers and consuming more and more resources; and causing all sorts of trouble for the oceans, from overfishing to filling them up with plastic. (Did you know researchers expect the ocean to be equal parts fish and plastic, by weight, as soon as 2050?)This subject certainly is alarming, especially when you consider the global picture.Another frightening data point in this trend toward extinction emerged on Thursday in a report from the World Wildlife Fund, an environmental advocacy group. The report claims 58% declines in certain vertebrate animal populations since 1970 and says that if trends continue, then two-thirds of all of these individual birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals will be gone by 2020.Some scientists see those numbers as potentially misleading. Stuart Pimm, the Doris Duke chair of conservation ecology at Duke University, told me that 58% is “a fairly silly kind of number to report because it mixes what’s going on in the ocean with what’s going on in the land.” He continued, “It mixes studies of bird populations in Europe with mammal populations in Africa. It has very few data points in South America. The idea that you in the media can only handle a single number to summarize the state of the planet – you should be insulted by that.”I agree with Pimm that these numbers can be misleading, but that’s only if people misunderstand them. I also spoke with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford University. He told me the most important thing to remember is that this report is limited in scope – it has little data from some important tropical regions, for example, and only covers animals with backbones. But it highlights an important and little-considered fact: It’s not just that species are going extinct at an alarming rate – at least 100 times what could be considered “normal,” and maybe much higher than that – but that populations of still-common animals are declining very rapidly.“I don’t think I would quibble with the trend they’re pointing out – we’re losing individuals of species and geographic ranges at a really rapid rate,” he told me. “If you keep that up, extinction of lots of species is inevitable.”Importantly, the WWF report deals with individual animals disappearing, not with entire species.A mass extinction, by definition, means three-quarters of all species disappear.That could happen in 100 or 200 years, Barnosky said, but not by 2020.Don’t look at that figure and think we have time to count our blessings. Barnosky told me we have maybe 10 to 20 years to stop the sixth extinction from becoming an inevitability. If we do nothing, expect three-quarters of species to disappear over the next century or two. In other words, what we do (or don’t do) right now will shape generations on this planet.“Yes, species are going extinct very, very much faster than they should be,” Pimm said, “which means we are depriving countless generations to come the extremely rich diversity we inherited from our parents.”And others experts, including Paul Ehrlich, the Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University, say the sixth extinction is already here.“We’ve probably lost, say, 200 species – kinds of big animals – over the last couple of hundred years, but we may well have lost on the order of a billion different populations,” he said. “We are basically annihilating the life on our planet and that is the only known life we know about in the entire universe. And it’s life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. And it’s life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don’t have the diversity of other organisms, we’re done.”Pimm told me we have “about a human generation” to do something before it’s likely too late.“If we don’t start doing a lot of things to stop extinction, we are going to see very significant losses of species,” he said. “There are a lot of things we can do and I would rather concentrate on the positive (rather) than just wallow in this really appalling number” presented by the World Wildlife Fund.“In the last 50 years, roughly, we’ve lost 50% of the individuals in these species,” Barnosky said. “If we lose another 50% in the next 50 years we’re down to 25% of the original. Basically, in a couple hundred years you’d have almost all of these species we’re talking about blinking out – if we keep going at that rate.”Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinions new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and FacebookWe know how to slow the rate of extinction. We need to ditch fossil fuels to blunt climate change. We need to protect more of the land and ocean on behalf of biodiversity. (The biologist E.O. Wilson has called for half of the world to be protected, a bold and exciting proposition.) We need to stop the spread of invasive species, and we’ve got to get a handle on illegal trades like that in ivory, which Barnosky said could wipe out Africa’s elephants in 20 years if poaching rates continue.The first step, however, is waking up to the crisis and its monstrous scope.“The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction,” he told me earlier this year, “is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone.”I’d rather imagine a world where we stop anything close to that from happening.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/10/27/opinions/sutter-wwf-sixth-extinction/index.html"}, {"title": "How to stop the sixth mass extinction", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Scientists warn the Earth is entering the sixth mass extinction.

This story is part of a CNN series called “Vanishing.” Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.CNN —The Earth is on the verge of a mass extinction event.To understand how big of a deal that is you don’t have to look much further than the definition of “mass extinction.” It means that three-quarters of all species vanish – forever.In all of history, that’s happened only five times.The sixth extinction would be the first caused by humans.“We are basically annihilating the life on our planet – and that is the only known life … in the entire universe,” said Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University.“It’s life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It’s life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don’t have the diversity of other organisms, we’re done.”I’ve been reporting on the coming extinction crisis this year for a CNN series called “Vanishing.” And I can tell you that while this topic is enormously depressing, there is some good news: We know how to slow or hopefully stop the sixth extinction.Anthony Barnosky, another extinction expert, also from Stanford, told me humans have at most 20 years to make sweeping changes about our relationship with nature. If we do that, he said, we can avoid the sixth extinction.But here’s what needs to happen, according to the experts.1. Stop burning fossil fuels06:08 - Source: CNN If coral reefs disappear, so will theyBurning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests is heating up the atmosphere. That’s creating trouble for all corners of the natural world, from the Rocky Mountains, where the tiny pika is overheating, to the oceans, where coral reefs are being decimated as the oceans warm and become more acidic.We know that to avert the worst of climate change we need to limit warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius. To do that, the world needs to be off fossil fuels this century – hopefully closer to 2030 than 2100. That’s a tall order, but Stanford University researchers have shown we can do it with existing technology like wind, solar and nuclear.Policies that promote cleaner energy include carbon taxes, cap-and-trade pollution pricing systems and renewable energy tax credits. The Paris Agreement on climate change, ratified by the United States and 115 other countries, also creates a framework for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels. The Trump administration in the United States, however, threatens to move the world’s second-biggest climate polluter away from that agreement and back towards dirty, climate-warming fuels.2. Protect half the Earth’s land – and oceans05:04 - Source: CNN The old man and the beeThis idea comes from renowned biologist E.O. Wilson: Put aside half the surface of the Earth – both land and oceans – for the betterment of the nature and biodiversity. Maybe that sounds like a lot, but Wilson argues it’s necessary if we want to avert crisis. Some 84% of species could be saved if we protected all that land. “That amount, as I and others have shown, can be put together from large and small fragments around the world to remain relatively natural, without removing people living there or changing property rights,” Wilson wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times.The trouble: We’re not protecting nearly enough, according to experts. Currently, only 15% of land and 4% of the world’s oceans are protected from encroachment by humans, mostly in the form of farms. Already, people have used up nearly 40% of the world’s land for farms and raising livestock – much of it to grow feed for cattle. Eating less meat – or going vegetarian – uses less land (and is far better for the climate; beef is an especially big polluter).3. Fight illegal wildlife trafficking05:49 - Source: CNN Iconic African elephant population on the brinkSome of the world’s most iconic species – particularly the elephant and rhino – are threatened with extinction simply because people are slaughtering these majestic creatures to sell their body parts on the black market. Elephant ivory is carved into trinkets. And rhino horn is mistakenly sold as an aphrodisiac.And there are other less-known markets, too, including those for pangolin meat (a delicacy), giraffe tails (bracelets) and tiger bone (medicine). Efforts to shut down these markets have been grossly inadequate, as the black market in environmental products is estimated to be worth $91 billion to $258 billion per year. Compare that to drug trafficking, the most lucrative black market, which is worth $344 billion per year, according to a United Nations and Interpol estimate.Experts say better law enforcement is needed to stop poaching. And consumers – especially those in Asia, where wildlife products tend to be popular – need to stop buying these illegal and harmful goods. Groups like WildAid and Education for Nature Vietnam are using advertising campaigns to try to make these products seem uncool.4. Slow human population growth05:17 - Source: CNN The birds on this island eat plasticIt sounds callous, but more people means more food, more land and more resources. Ehrlich, from Stanford, said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth’s extinction crisis. The population was about 4 billion in 1980. It’s now 7.4 billion and is rapidly heading for 9.7 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations.There are ways for each person to conserve, of course. The World Bank says the average American, for example, produces about 10 times as much climate-change pollution per year as an average person from India. And we needlessly use resources we know are harmful. Plastics, for example, are clogging the world’s oceans. We dump the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic into the ocean each minute, according to the World Economic Forum. Some researchers expect there to be more plastic than fish in the ocean, by weight, by the year 2050. That’s almost unthinkable.5. Reconnect with the natural world, and open our eyes05:40 - Source: CNN He can hear species disappearingIf there’s a fact that underlies all this, perhaps it’s this: We’re no longer connected to nature. We don’t understand it and therefore, naively, dangerously, we figure it’s doing just fine or will rebound. Barnosky, the extinction expert from Stanford, said we think of the natural world like a bottomless checking account when we need to see it as a savings account.We humans also have ridiculously short attention spans. Issues like extinction and climate change play out over decades, centuries and millennia. Our actions now – or inaction – will matter for thousands of years. “You can have catastrophic events that are seen in slow motion, basically, and not register on people very well,” said Ehrlich. We must find a way to reconnect with nature and to see this wave of extinction for the crisis that it is.Have other ideas or questions?

She served three tours—in Kenya, Guatemala and Jamaica—working on community-building projects and teaching English.After returning to the US in 1999, at age 69, Phillips realized there were countless people in her own backyard in need of her support.“It came to me that I didn’t have to leave the US or my hometown to help. I could do here what I did overseas,” she said.She became an AmeriCorps volunteer and moved around the country, eventually settling in Carson City, Nevada. There, immigrants make up roughly one in five of the state’s population. Phillips met many adult immigrants who were struggling to learn English.To address the need, she started the ESL In-Home Program of Northern Nevada, a nonprofit that provides free ESL (English as a Second Language), citizenship, GED and computer classes.Since its inception in 2004, the nonprofit has helped more than 5,000 immigrants and their families.Today, at 87 years old—when most people are deep in retirement—Phillips shows no signs of winding down.CNN’s Laura Klairmont spoke with Phillips about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What are some of the barriers that get in the way of immigrants accessing English classes?Florence Phillips: It was amazing to see how many immigrants there were that wanted to learn English. I got calls from all over Nevada. Many of these immigrants could not attend ESL classes because the schools and other organizations have a set schedule, and their times were not convenient for the student who works three jobs. So, my program teaches morning, noon, night, weekends, holidays. We provide these services at the times and days that the student is available and wherever the student is or can be. My program is very flexible.We teach English on all levels to immigrants and refugees in Northern Nevada who want to learn. There is no other program like this in the state. We give the students personal attention; I match them with a tutor. We teach at no cost to the student.03:33 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: American DreamsThere are people who were living in rural counties and in other counties where they did not have transportation if there was a class available for them to go to. If they lack transportation, just had a baby, are sick or disabled, we will tutor in their own homes or the tutor’s home.CNN: Your program also provides free classes that help people prepare for their citizenship test.Phillips: It is a very difficult test. A lot of Americans say they could not pass. These people have to know the answers to questions about the branches of government, how many senators there are, etc. It’s a lot of history, a lot of civics, a lot about our government. They have to know how to write, how to read. They have to know how to converse in English with the interviewer. We do all of that for them. We have a mock interview at the end of the class so that they know what to expect when they go for their exam. It takes a commitment of coming to a 12-week class. It takes a lot of memorization.To apply for citizenship today, it costs more than $700. Many of our students cannot afford to apply. So, we help to raise money to help these students apply.Whether they’re working two, three jobs, they have to sit down and study every single day, and they make that commitment because it is their desire to become an American. My students inspire me because of their dedication, their commitment, their motivation to learn.CNN: How has your work affected the lives of your students?Phillips: I have students that were promoted to be supervisor. I get students who call me and say, “I was able to talk with the teacher about my child.” And I’m being told by the students that they went to the market and the clerk understood them. Those are the rewards I get as they progress.My students love this country. They are very proud about being here, learning English, learning our culture. I see the pride when they say, “I am an American.”Want to get involved?

Her nonprofit, Poetic Justice, started in one location. Now the program is in five female prisons in Oklahoma.As Stackable began meeting the women in prison, she learned many of them were first-time, non-violent offenders. She began to hear their stories and learn about their difficult lives.“These women have been failed by everyone,” Stackable said. “They have childhood trauma; many have been sexually abused or experienced domestic violence. When you learn what they’ve been through, you understand how they found their way to prison.”During the weekly Poetic Justice classes, the women meditate, learn about poetry and creative writing, brainstorm and then spend time writing. Volunteers help prompt ideas and provide individual attention. At the end of class, the women can share their work with one another.When people read what these women have written, they are blown away. CNN Hero Ellen Stackable“It’s a sacred place where you can write, and you can feel free to share your writing and trust people in a place where no one trusts anybody,” Stackable said. “In a place that never feels safe, you make a safe place.”At the end of the eight-week course, each woman receives a printed book containing a collection of their group’s work.“When people read what these women have written, they are blown away,” Stackable said. “Everyone assumes they’re in prison, so they must be dumb. But they are talented, creative and incredible writers.”For Stackable – whose group has reached more than 2,500 women – this is about much more than writing. She views these courses as a therapeutic way for the women to work through past trauma and find healing.03:35 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: Poetic Justice“I see these women gain self-confidence and find self-worth,” she said. “I just want them to find hope. If they can find hope, it can change their lives.”CNN’s Meghan Dunn spoke with Stackable about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What inspired you to bring writing to these women?Stackable: I wanted something that I felt like wasn’t just me reaching down and giving somebody something, but giving them a tool and a way that they could change and empower themselves.Once they find out they can write, no one’s ever going to be able to take that away. The only true freedom they have to hold is within themselves, because everything else can be taken away from them. So, writing becomes really infinitely more powerful for them.CNN: What changes have you seen in them?Stackable: I see women being restored to their families. I see them making a difference in other prisoners’ lives. I see them changing the atmosphere within prison. And I think that writing is part of that. But underlying writing is a sense of self-worth and employment and agency. To have those things while you’re in prison is just counter to the entire system.CNN: You start each new class with the women setting the rules.Stackable: I think in order to know that you matter, you have to feel like you have a choice in something. So, everything that we do in the class is to eliminate the hierarchy these women have always been part of. They’ve always been the bottom of it, and even more so in prison. So, we allow them to make the rules.Creating a safe place in the most unsafe place is at the heart of what we do. And from that, writing flows easily. And then with writing comes healing and hope and change.CNN: What keeps you motivated?Stackable: I think, ultimately, it’s because these women are worth it. They matter. I walk away from every class I teach encouraged and just honored to be there.There’s no coincidence that prisons are often in out-of-the-way rural places. It’s because we don’t want to see them. We don’t want to know what’s happening. So, for me to be able to tell their story and for them to tell their story, that’s the motivation.Want to get involved?

But this mission was never something he’d set out to do.In 2013, Steklenski began working at a company closer to his home, which led him to the idea of becoming a pilot.“I started driving to my new job, and I would pass this small airfield,” said Steklenski, a network engineer. “I don’t know why, but I just decided one day to go in and sign up for flying lessons.”While training to get his pilot license, his family decided to adopt a dog. The process opened his eyes to a world he didn’t know existed.“You learn about this huge underground railroad of people who volunteer their time, money, and energy to get these animals out of kill shelters,” Steklenski said. “I became so aware and more compassionate to all animals.”He got his license a few months later and realized he could do more than fly for recreation.“I thought, this is a way I can use an ability I have to help move a large amount of animals in a short amount of time,” he said.Since starting the organization, Steklenski has completed nearly 100 flights to save animals, all paid for out of his own pocket. The organization now has its own plane and transports to rescue groups in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.“We’re only in the plane for a short period of time, but that time is so precious to me,” he said. “There are moments we share in that plane that I will never forget.”CNN’s Meghan Dunn spoke with Steklenski about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What did you learn about the need in rescuing these animals?Paul Steklenski: There is a huge need to help get animals out of kill shelters. I learned that if they don’t get out of certain areas of this country, they don’t live. The further South you get, the worse it gets. And there are so many organizations up north that are no-kill that will take these animals.Once I became an airman, it was natural. Knowing that I could take a day off from work and quite literally help save the lives of a dozen or more animals just by doing this, that was it. I didn’t need to know any more.CNN: What’s it like to be on such a small plane with more than a dozen dogs?Steklenski: Every dog that steps foot on our plane is a ‘paw-senger.’ I’ll look to who is the most scared or the most terrified and know that if I put them next to me, they’ll be calmed. A lot of times depending on the size of my copilot, he’ll kind of shimmy over, and get on my lap and fall asleep.01:09 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: Top DogUsually once the engine starts up, they hear the noise and the vibration – everybody settles in. Some will look out the window or they’ll fall asleep. It’s usually a non-event. It’s preferable to flying with people in a lot of ways!But it’s bittersweet in the sense that you’ve got to spend maybe two hours with them, and they start to bond with you a little bit, and now they’re moving on. It’s just what you have to do; they have to move on to their next step.CNN: You dedicate a lot of time to flying animals. How do you juggle it with your full-time job?Steklenski: My full-time job helps pay for this. I spend over $1,000 a month out of my pocket to do this. I need my job to fulfill these missions and help save these animals.When I look back in time, when I was renting airplanes all the time and had to drive an hour to the airport with crates in my truck – I look back now, I’m like, “Wow, you were nuts.” It’s just not something you really focus on. You’re focused on what the next mission is, what’s the next group of dogs I need to help. When it’s something you’re very passionate about, I don’t think you really measure the amount of energy or time or sacrifice you put into it. You just do it.CNN: What’s the future of the organization look like?Steklenski: The future of Flying Fur is take us to the next level and get a dedicated farm in Pennsylvania with an airstrip that I can fly animals into directly, where we can have an intake and adoption and rehab center.I also want to upgrade our aircraft to something bigger that can go further. I don’t know how I’m going to get there yet, and it’s going to take a lot of money. But that’s my challenge. I’ve made it this far in three years.

The pantry’s shelves overflowed with some items while other foods were desperately needed.In 2009, when she was 14, the pantry received a huge donation of macaroni and cheese that was more than the community could use, and she saw how hard it was to contact other charities that could take it.Kathleen Toner/CNN CNN Hero Maria Rose BeldingMonths later, she had to throw away hundreds of expired boxes as people waited in line for food.“I remember just crying and being so angry,” said Belding, now 22. “There was nothing that really allowed us to communicate in an efficient way. … The Internet was right in front of us!”Belding had stumbled upon two problems that still plague the U.S. food system. According to the USDA, more than 40 million Americans don’t regularly have enough to eat while up to 40% of the country’s food supply is wasted.In high school, she developed an idea for an online database that could solve both problems, but she didn’t have the programming skills to make it work. After graduating, she met Grant Nelson, a law student who was writing code on his laptop.About nine months later, during Belding’s freshman year at American University, they launched MEANS, a free online platform that connects businesses with extra food to charities that feed the hungry.Run largely by high school and college students, the nonprofit has helped redistribute more than 1.8 million pounds of food since 2015.“Too often, grocery stores and restaurants find themselves throwing out food when there is great need in nearby communities,” Belding said. “MEANS aims to make it easier to donate food than throw it in the dumpster. … We’re like a bridge that hasn’t existed before.”CNN spoke to Belding about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What does MEANS stand for, and how does it work?Maria Rose Belding: MEANS is an acronym that stands for Matching Excess And Need for Stability; 14-year-old me had a fondness for acronyms.It’s pretty simple. If you want to get food from MEANS, you have to be registered as a legal charity in the United States. So, when a soup kitchen, homeless shelter or a food pantry needs something, they tell our system. And when a grocery store, caterer or food retailer has something they want to donate, all they have to do is go online and say, “This is where I am, this is what I’ve got, and this is when I need it gone by.” Then the system automatically notifies all of those who have said, “I need things within these parameters.” We’re able to match up excess and need very, very quickly. At this point, MEANS has about 3,000 partners in 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The Emerson Act – a ‘Good Samaritan’ law passed in 1996 – protects donors from liability.We’re also part of a great partnership with the Rhode Island Health Department called Rhode to End Hunger, which encourages businesses to donate food to nonprofits. One of the shining stars of that is the Twin River Casino. They’ll post hundreds of pounds of food, and somebody in Providence – like McAuley House, which is feeding a lot of folks who are struggling – will claim it really fast. The average in Rhode Island is about 10 minutes for things to move.CNN: What are some of the most unusual donations you’ve had?Belding: We’ve got all these awesome stories. People think, “Oh, no one’s going to want that” – we can prove you wrong. We have had 50 pounds of squab – which is fancy baby pigeon – from a five-star restaurant in Seattle. That ended up being used in pork and beans – apparently it was a big hit. We’ve found home for 250 pounds of rutabagas, 11,000 pounds of green beans, 42,000 pounds of milk. We’ll find a home for it 95% of the time. The average amount of time it takes for food to be claimed is half an hour. Our record is two minutes and 37 seconds.You’d think the novelty would wear off – nope! In our office, every time you see a donation go live on our admin panel, and then you see somebody has claimed it, you’re like, “It worked!” When you see food move, you know that that’s people getting to eat that maybe wouldn’t have been able to – or maybe they’re getting to eat better than they would have. You’re also keeping food from going to landfills. It’s just great for everybody.CNN: How do you balance running MEANS with being a full-time student?Belding: Pretty much everybody on our staff is running between classes, labs and work. Our original office was split between my co-founder Grant’s apartment and the basement of my freshman year dorm. Now we’re in the American University Center for Innovation, and this semester my physics class was down the hall, so I literally ran there a minute before class started.I actually took a year off to devote myself to MEANS full time. Now I am a rising senior and will graduate next May with my pre-medical requirements met. I’m definitely not having a normal college experience. I’ve never been to a Greek life event, I’m not in any clubs, and I know I would have a much better G.P.A. if I wasn’t doing this. But this is more important than me.What makes it worth it is knowing that we’re building something that matters a lot more than we do.Want to get involved?

And that’s what she slept on, that’s what her bed was,” Mickelson said. “When we delivered the bed, she hugged it and just couldn’t let go.”Shocked to discover how widespread this need was in his close-knit community, Mickelson founded Sleep in Heavenly Peace, a nonprofit that builds and delivers beds to children in need.“It was such an eye-opener to me,” he recalled. “I sat there in silence thinking, ‘Is that really what’s going on?’”Born and raised in Idaho, Mickelson, now 41, was a high school quarterback-turned-family-man. A churchgoer with a thriving career, he coached his kids’ sports teams and fished in the nearby river.

In 2017, we built 612 bunk beds.”Mickelson set up a formal charity, complete with training courses, construction manuals and local chapters so communities from coast to coast could join the movement.With the motto “No kid sleeps on the floor in our town,” the nonprofit and its more than 65 chapters have built and delivered more than 1,500 free beds to children across America.But along with the rapid growth, Mickelson was faced with a tough choice: advancing his career or his nonprofit. He chose the latter and went from making “great money to zero money.” He’s never looked back.“I found that the need I have isn’t financial,” he said. “The need I have is seeing the joy on kids’ faces, knowing that I can make a difference.”CNN’s Allie Torgan spoke with Mickelson about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: Who are your group’s bed recipients?02:28 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: How to brand a bedLuke Mickelson: These kids that we serve in our community come to us from all walks of life. They didn’t get into this situation because of their choices. Often, they take their clothes off at night, put their pajamas on, and sleep on top of their clothes. And then they just repeat that cycle every day.We have a lot of situations where single parents are escaping an abusive situation. A lot of foster care situations, where parents or grandparents or brothers and sisters are trying to help. A lot of homelessness, people trying to get back on their feet. A $300 or $400 bed is just out of the possibility for them.CNN: How do they find you?Mickelson: For someone looking to apply for a bed, they can go to our website and click on “Request a Bed.” Once that application gets filled out, based on the zip code of the recipient, it goes to the closest chapter president, then through a vetting process. Right now, we average over 25 applications a day, nationwide. We don’t have any paid staff right now and we’re growing like a weed. We’re keeping up with that the best we can.CNN: You quit your job and take no salary from the nonprofit. How do you make ends meet?Mickelson: I quit my job of 18 years because I wanted to do this full-time, or at least as much as I possibly could, because I knew the need was big. It just came to a point where I could see that my passion really is helping these kids. It was gratifying to see my kids and my family be involved with it and help them learn the value of service, but also seeing everybody else feel and see that joy from helping kids get off the floor. It’s contagious.I was very fortunate to have another company offer me a job. Granted, I took a huge pay cut, but it helps me get by and helps me do what I need to do with Sleep in Heavenly Peace. They’re very understanding of what my passion is.CNN: How do the children react to their new beds?Mickelson: When we deliver a bed, that’s where the rubber meets the road. We make sure that they understand that, “This is your bed. This is yours. This is a possession of yours,” you know?The underlying tone is, “We’re here for the child.” You walk in and these kids are just so excited. They want to help build it. They want to run the drills.

I was a dancer; an aerobics dancer with big hair in the ‘80s,” said Boxtel, now 50. “I felt invincible. And that all changed in a split second.”Despite her injury, Boxtel didn’t stop living life. In the 26 years since, she’s had many adventures: skiing, mountain biking, parasailing, traveling the world.“Destiny waits for no woman,” Boxtel often says. “There wasn’t the technology we have today. So, I had to figure out a lot for myself. I started my own fitness regimen and found my new life.”In 2010, she learned about bionic exoskeleton suits – machines that help people with mobility issues walk. In an exoskeleton, Boxtel took her first step in 18 years.She loved it so much, she raised funds to purchase her own. In a little more than a year, she took about 130,000 steps in the machine. Her health began to improve, her chronic pain started to decrease, and she felt stronger than ever.“Human bodies are meant to stand and walk,” she said.But Boxtel also felt guilty, realizing this technology was not easily accessible or affordable.“I thought, ‘Amanda, why do you have to be the lucky girl? This is a fully adjustable device. We could get a whole community up and walking with this unit.’ “In 2014, she started Bridging Bionics to do just that. The nonprofit provides high-tech physical therapy to people with mobility impairments near Aspen, Colorado.The program is based in two local fitness facilities. The group’s physical therapists work one-on-one with clients, creating individualized plans based on their mobility issues – ranging from spinal cord injuries to neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and Parkinson’s disease.“I wanted to … put it into a health club that promoted wellbeing, where someone could just walk in an exoskeleton doing physical therapy, but alongside someone else on a treadmill,” Boxtel said. “Disability can be socially isolating, and we are about bridging community, getting people out of their homes and engaging.”The organization has provided its free or low-cost therapeutic sessions to more than 60 people, helping them overcome their injuries and do something doctors never believed possible: walk again.CNN’s Meghan Dunn spoke with Boxtel about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What was it like the first time you stood up in an exoskeleton suit?Amanda Boxtel: When I stood up, I looked at the world from a new perspective. It was as if all my dreams were burgeoning to life in one upright, powerful moment. It was psychological.For the first time, I could look across the room at things high. I wasn’t looking up at nostrils or looking at navels. My world changed. It was not just this amazing physiological thing that happened to me. I could look at someone eye to eye, and I could have that delicious heart to heart hug.CNN: Your organization uses two types of technology. What are they, and how do they help?Boxtel: I incorporated whole body, side-alternating vibration and the bionic exoskeleton suit. I believe that the combination of these two technologies can reduce the risk of secondary complications associated with paralysis and neuromuscular impairments. The combination gives you a cardio workout, an increase in joint range of motion and circulation, especially in the paralyzed extremities. The main thing is a decrease in spasticity. Tone reduction or spasticity is so common, and these technologies combat that.02:51 - Source: CNN CNN Heroes: Learning to walk...againThe exoskeleton on its own takes it a step further. You can fully weight bear; it is fully supporting the individual, and that is critical for bone density. Your joints and bones are aligned as they were designed to be. It helps a person walk over ground, but not with stiff legs. It is a very natural gait, where I am bending my knee and I am striking the ground with my heel as you do when you walk. But I am walking over ground through space with the world going by me – so I am getting the visual cues to help rewire the brain and reconnect neuropathways. And there is evidence that just pure robotics assist and repetitive stepping over ground is rehabilitative.CNN: You’re also helping people have access to this technology all the time, beyond the therapy sessions.Boxtel: We help people with fundraising campaigns to acquire advanced technology to use at home – so they can access this every day. If you can have this at home every day, it will help with secondary complications and recovery. But it is daunting when you find out something costs $90,000. So, that’s where we come in and provide fundraising materials and fundraising ideas to help.Everybody should have access to this technology. That’s my goal. How do we make this for humanity so that people don’t just sit at home? People need to start believing in themselves and their potential. Life isn’t over. They can still recover.Want to get involved?

I stared at her bruised inner thighs, her sheets wet with urine and blood, her catheter pulled completely out of her. I covered her with a blanket and held her close as she pleaded, \"Get me out of here.\"I kissed her forehead, our tears mixing, and promised no one was going to stop me. She would not spend another night in this nursing home.I pushed the call button. No response. I followed the cord to the wall and found it disconnected. My heart racing, I tracked down an aide and demanded that a nurse come to my mothers room immediately. At 88, she was examined with nonchalance and covered back up.I called the manager to her room and told her I was taking Mom home.The nursing staff gathered in force, attempting to convince me that her release was a long process, that my mother could still benefit from their help. Her stay in the nursing home had been a temporary transition needed after being hospitalized with a stroke.But I knew my mother had been harmed. I feared the worse. And I feared for her life if she stayed there.I called her doctor to sign a release form, and I phoned a service for private medical transport. I also called my husband and said, \"I need to bring Mom home with us today. Go get Daddy.\"At the front door of the nursing home, the management staff lined up to wish us well. They invited us to come back and visit.\"Thank you,\" I told them, \"but we will never drive by this road again.\"When we arrived home, the driver unloaded my bundled mother and the rain momentarily stopped. I looked up and saw my father, his hand pressed to the window, tears in his eyes and mouthing the words \"Mama ... Mamas home.\" Married 69 years, my parents experienced every second apart as an eternity.Once settled in their own bed, Daddy curled up next to Mother, held her hand, prayed with her, assured her she was OK now, home safe. She was still recovering from her stroke, and even though my father sensed some harm had come to her, he didnt ask. He didnt want to stress her more. He never left her side.Medical equipment, photos of happier times and leftover Christmas decorations fill Marilyn Youngs bedroom.Over the weeks that followed, my mother complained of pain in her groin area. Doctors increased the doses of pain medication, but she still awoke in anguish, day after day. I finally had to examine her -- and my heart sank.I knew she needed to be seen by her gynecologist as soon as possible.A nurse practitioner examined my mother and ran tests to confirm her suspicions: a sexually transmitted disease. Had my mother shown these symptoms before, she asked. The answer was no. Had my mother had any sexual partners besides my father in her lifetime? The answer was no.When I told her about what had happened in the nursing home, the nurse said my father would need to be tested for the disease. My mother was visibly shaken. I asked the nurse, if my father was negative, what would be the next step? She said, you need to call the California Department of Public Health and file a report.We drove home silently. My mind struggled with how much my mother had been through; now we were minutes away from devastating my father. I asked if she wanted my help in telling Daddy. The answer was yes.As I spoke, Daddy didnt hesitate to agree to be tested. Then he asked what all of this meant. What would proving he was negative for the disease mean?Mama, her voice choked with sadness, replied: \"I was raped.\"My father held my mother, crying, shaking his head in disbelief and apologizing for not being able to keep her safe.I grew up believing my parents were strong and took comfort trusting I would always be safe. They both worked two or three jobs throughout my childhood to buy me and my siblings encyclopedias to enhance our knowledge of the world long before Google existed.Witnessing this wound inflicted on my parents cut deeply to the core of my own foundation. The hospital had recommended the nursing home as a transitional step; her own internist was the director of the facility: What could possibly go wrong?There were no warning flags. We failed to protect her against something we could not even imagine existed. A distress signal is only as good as the person who sees it. When I saw it, I took action. But it was too late.For months, my parents comforted each other, not wanting to be even a foot apart. Their love never wavered; it only deepened. I would walk past their bedroom and see them snuggled tightly together, whispering. My father later told me they were praying and planning to renew their wedding vows on their 70th anniversary.Beyond the harm the perpetrator had inflicted on my mother, he took a toll on my fathers remaining strength and stole some of the precious time my parents had left. Still, together they decided to fight for reform, which my husband and I fully supported. We filed a civil lawsuit against the facility, arguing that more should have been done to protect my mother. She was brave enough to appear at the center of a public service video created by a nonprofit calling for nursing home reform.After taking her mother into her own home, Bobbi Young cared for her until Marilyn passed away in January.Two months before my father passed away at 95, he told my mother his time was near and asked my husband and I to help them renew their vows early. They exchanged their promises tearfully and glowed with renewed divinity. He did not live long enough to see my mother receive a settlement in her case against the nursing home.On the day my father died, my husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. His painful journey ended 17 months later. But our commitment to choose love and joy enabled Mother and I to embrace our faith and carry on. I promised my husband I would not be sad or bitter. I had promised my father I would care for Mama and keep her safe.I feared that I would not be able to fulfill those promises.But there are moments in life that transcend fear. They mend twisted hearts. This became one of those moments.After my husbands funeral, all of my mothers nurturing traits intensified. I had promised to care for her, and now she was providing me with what felt like a second childhood. She took the reins, suggesting remedies such as extra locks on doors and an alarm system to quiet our fears. She reminded me of recipes to help stretch our dollars to survive -- such as making \"imagination cookies.\" When I looked sad, she would talk about funny things my husband did to make her laugh. We prayed together, planned our spring garden, went for drives on hot days with the windows down, hair blowing in the wind, laughing with memories.I promised my mother I would honor her vow to carry on her courageous battle for justice all the days of my life by telling her story. While her perpetrator will likely never be found, it was one of her last wishes for people to understand that no one is too old to become a victim of rape.My mother died in January. She was 94. As I walk around my home now, I look at the empty rocking chair in which she soothed her children. I can feel her brushing my long hair. The seedlings she planted in eggshells on Christmas Day are bursting toward spring. I can hear her laughter and her reminder to me: \"The gifts God gave you, he did not give to another; respect them and share them wisely. ...\"Who was this woman in my life? Why was she made to suffer so?An answer fills my sorrowful heart:Suffering can carve two types of people, monsters and angels. I am fortunate to have been raised by angels. And I pray to one day be worthy of that divine fabric that still holds me tightly together -- love.Editors note: Bobbi Young lives in Carmel Valley, California, where she cared for her mother during her final days.

And even when the cases of nursing home residents get to court, they can fall apart when victims memories prove unreliable -- or they are no longer alive to testify.This time was different.The two women made their way to the courthouse in Waynesville, North Carolina, last week to testify against the man entrusted with their care.One entered the courtroom in her wheelchair, two oxygen tanks behind her, and defiantly described the February night when 58-year-old Luis Gomez lifted up her nightgown. He had entered her room at the Brian Center, a nursing home in the center of town, when she was alone and asked if she needed to go the bathroom. She said she did, and climbed out of bed. As she entered the bathroom and faced the toilet, she heard the door close and lock. Then, she said, Gomez raped her.At first, no one acted on her accusation, and she feared Gomez might appear in her room again at any moment. But when a nurse insisted on notifying police -- against the wishes of her boss -- the call triggered an investigation. And women just down the hall from the resident came forward, with their own allegations against Gomez.Now he has been sentenced to at least 23 years behind bars.\"What this man has done for a period of almost a decade is ... prey on Alzheimers patients because theyre forgetful and they cant remember and oftentimes they die,\" the prosecutor told the judge during sentencing.\"In 2016, Your Honor, he made the grave mistake of hurting the wrong woman. She was brave enough to tell, and she wouldnt be quiet until everybody listened. And because of her, thats the only reason that we are finally able to put him in prison.\"After a weeklong trial, Gomez was found guilty of raping both women who testified against him -- convicted on six counts that included forcible rape with a physically helpless victim. He still maintains his innocence, and is appealing the verdict.What should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie HickenAt his sentencing, the prosecutor said the two women who testified against him were not his only victims.Six others have accused him, she said. At three different facilities in the area. Some were in their 50s and 60s. At least one was nearly 90.None were believed, until the woman who was raped in her nightgown came forward. Gomezs attorney told jurors they shouldnt believe her either.\"He told me Im untruthful, and I said, no I am not,\" the victim, now 55, said of the lawyers questioning. \"He made me feel like I was a worm crawling on the ground.\" CNN does not typically identify victims of sexual abuse.The weeklong trial of Luis Gomez took place at the Haywood County Courthouse in Waynesville.Gomezs attorney, Joel Schechet, told the court that his client is a \"good man\" who came to America after almost dying from an assault in Guatemala. \"To this day, I would contend he never committed an act that was inappropriate to any of these people making these allegations,\" he said, adding that had the jury found him innocent,Gomez was prepared to leave the country and return home.The Brian Center paid a six-figure fine after regulators found it had failed to protect residents from sexual abuse. A spokesperson for its parent company said it was pleased the case was over and that it had been unaware of the multiple allegations against Gomez until the police investigation began.Months before the trial, a CNN investigation into sexual abuse at nursing homes had discovered many of these same accusations against Gomez at three different nursing facilities in Haywood County. At least some had been reported to the state.But because investigators were unable to substantiate any of the complaints, Gomezs record remained clean and he continued work as a nursing aide.Asked whether the Gomez case would spur change, such as a way to track a pattern of unsubstantiated complaints against nursing home employees, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has said the agency is simply following federal and state laws.They refused to comment on just how many times Gomez was investigated in the past. But in court, the prosecutor ticked off each accusation, one by one:In 2011, years before Gomez worked at the Brian Center, a woman with severe Alzheimers said he had touched her inappropriately while cleaning her up at another nursing home in town, prompting a law enforcement investigation. At first, she insisted it had happened. But then she said, \"Well, maybe Im confused.\"Two years later, a resident at yet another nursing home screamed when she awoke to Gomez touching her. She was living in the Alzheimers wing, even though she didnt suffer from the condition.The following year, an Alzheimers patient at the same facility reported that he had pressed her \"down there.\" But she said she was \"afraid\" and didnt want to get him in trouble. She has since passed away.After that, the accusations started piling up at the Brian Center.Nursing aide Luis Gomez most recently lived in this house, according to property records.In 2015, a resident said Gomez touched her breasts and told her he wanted to marry her. Another woman, whod suffered a stroke, told staff that Gomez molested her. She was promptly committed to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital. Within months, a different woman insisted Gomez had touched her while changing her diaper, but said that no one believed her. And yet another said she had silently endured weeks of sexual abuse that left her terrified.The woman who said he raped her in the bathroom was his eighth accuser.Before the judge sentenced Gomez, the victim asked to have a word with him. The sheriff wheeled her up to face him. Then she spoke.\"The Lord loves you,\" she told her attacker. \"Even though what you did is wrong, the Good Book says that I must love you, even though you did me wrong; and I do. I love you, and I pray that the others learn to forgive you and love you as I have. May you go in peace.\"Gomez sat silently and cried, she said.She returned to the Brian Center, where she says memories of her abuse still haunt her. The day of the verdict, she said, was the best day of her life.She was finally believed.\"It felt like a ton of bricks were off my shoulders,\" said the woman, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. \"I wanted to scream in the courtroom, Yeehaw!\"News of the verdict quickly made its way around town, reaching another woman who had accused Gomez of sexual abuse -- the stroke victim who had been sent to the psych ward.The stroke victim sent to the psychiatric ward after accusing Gomez of molesting her says his sentence is not enough.\"I was glad that people did believe it, and something was done about it,\" she said, speaking on the phone from the facility where she lives now, many miles from the Brian Center. But she wasnt satisfied with the outcome. \"What he did was a lot worse than what hes paying for.\"The nurse who supervised Gomez and defied her boss by triggering the police investigation said she, too, was also glad the victims were believed. Even if her life has been upended.She said she suffered panic attacks for months leading up to the trial. She was fired from the Brian Center days after notifying police, and she said she plans to sue the facility to make a statement: that nurses will not be forced to act unethically.\"I couldnt live with myself if I did not make the call,\" said 36-year-old Krista Shalda. \"I could not go to bed at night if I knew I was the reason someone was getting sexually assaulted.\"She doubts she will ever work in a nursing home again. Facilities are reluctant to hire a whistleblower, she said. She also knows that she wouldnt be able to stop herself from worrying about what could be happening behind closed doors.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/08/20/health/nursing-home-aide-rape-trial-guilty/index.html"}, {"title": "How artificial intelligence and robots can change your living spaces", "data_published": "2017-08-24T09:45:44Z", "content": "Written by By Oscar Holland, CNNDutch designer Joris Laarman has built his career through emerging technologies like 3D printing and robotics.But as a student 15 years ago, he didnt even own a computer.\"After my graduation I got a computer, which changed everything,\" he said in a phone interview. \"My generation was the first to know what it was like before computers, but who also grew up with them.\"Now the 37-year-old cant work without one. From open source furniture designs to a 3D-printed footbridge made from stainless steel, Laarmans work lies at the intersection of design and technology.His company, Joris Laarman Lab , pushes at the experimental edges of an industry that has digitalized rapidly since he graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2003.\"Were trying to figure out what the design of the future will be -- what it could look like,\" he said.Digital toolboxOne of Laarmans best-known designs is the Bone Chair, which was created through algorithms that mimic bone growth. Using a large volume of computer-generated calculations, Laarmans program systematically adjusted and strengthened the chairs design.\"Birds bones have super-optimal construction -- they constantly adapt themselves by taking away material where its not needed and adding material where it is, without losing strength,\" he explained.\"To me, an algorithm is just a new high-tech version of a saw or a pair of scissors -- its just a tool. The designs that we make are never finished objects, theyre more like programs that we can tweak into new forms and adapt themselves accordingly.\"Technology is not only changing designers methods, but also the type of products they can create. More than a simple efficiency measure, Laarman says that digitalization makes entirely new concepts possible.\"(The shape of the Bone Chair) could never have been invented without the algorithm. Youd need really heavy calculations for such an evolutionary process.\"If you were to do this manually, without a computer, youd have to break the legs of the chair thousands of times to make it stronger and to know where to add or take away material.\"Design to downloadThe Bone Chair is set to go on display at the New Yorks Cooper Hewitt, The Smithsonian Design Museum , alongside other highlights from Laarmans career, including a set of tables made from reprogrammable molecular building blocks called voxels.The exhibition, titled \" Joris Laarman Lab: Design in the Digital Age ,\" encourages visitors to interact with technologies that may soon become commonplace, said the shows curator Andrea Lipps.\"(Experimental) designers often end up creating things that are so completely foreign that they become almost indigestible,\" she said. \"Whats interesting about Joris work is that theres a familiarity to it that makes it feel less threatening. These designers are the early adopters -- theyre taking our hand and leading us into the future.\"While Lipps wants the exhibition to be an \"interactive, participatory experience,\" visitors wont get a chance to sit on any of Laarmans chairs. They will, however, be able to download some of the design blueprints.\"You can download one (of the chairs) for free and make it yourself -- or have it produced by your neighbor if they have a 3D printer,\" Laarman said. \"There are now platforms that show where the 3D printers in your neighborhood are.\"The next industrial revolutionThis tools used by Laarman are just some of the digital methods transforming the design industry. Robotics, 3D printing and virtual reality are all changing the way products are made -- from super-strong digitally fabricated materials to cars designed in thin air using VR goggles.According to research by the consulting firm McKinsey, the cost of 3D printing fell 60 percent between 1990 and 2014, while the price of industrial robots fell by 5 percent every year between 2000 and 2012.This move from industrial to digital production represents a fundamental shift in the economy of design, said Laarman, comparing the transition to the industrial revolution.\"Modernists in the early 20th century were developing new form languages for the dawn of a new industrial period. It was very much dependent on standardization and geometric shapes.\"Right now, you can see digital fabrication is taking off and this leads to a completely new type of form language. Its still very early, but everybody sees the potential. Digital design, biotechnology, AI and robotics are going to completely change everything in the world, at every level of society.

Before the Edo period (c.1615-1868), tattoos were primarily used as crude markers of punishment for petty criminals or of fealty for lovers, or else the domain of the indigenous Ainu tribes of the northern islands.According to \"Tattoos in Japanese Prints,\" a new publication from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it was only in the 19th century that they were elevated to the level of art.Author Sarah E. Thompson, curator of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, traces their popularity back to the publication of \"One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin,\" a series of woodblock prints by the artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, between 1827 and 1830.His prints, adapted from a 14th-century Chinese novel, saw bandit heroes covered with elaborate, full-body tattoos rendered in impressive detail. The common motifs -- dragons and demons, fearsome predators, koi fish and cherry blossoms -- were laden with meaning, and added another layer to the narrative.1 / 13 – A triptych from \"A Contemporary Water Margin: Pine, Bamboo, and Plum\" (1858) by Utagawa Kunisada Artist Utagawa Kunisada was one of the first to popularize tattoos in woodblock prints in the 19th century. Here hes depicted three actors in various roles, their tattoos meant to evoke characters from the books and plays of the day. Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\"By emphasizing the tattoos sported by some of the heroes, Kuniyoshis print designs not only exploited the allure of the exotic but also provided a titillating hint of the illicit -- especially if the suggestion that pictorial tattoos in Japan had been outlaws and spread to fashionable urbanites is correct,\" Thompson writes.The impact of the \"Water Margin\" series and similar works from Kuniyoshi and his contemporaries was immediate and broad-reaching. Men across class lines requested tattoos of scenes from \"Water Margins\" -- and, in some cases, the characters tattoos. Textile artists started incorporating tattoo-like prints into their designs; kabuki stars painted simple designs onto their skin for performances.(The tattoos did have their detractors, however. In 1872, as Japan started its push toward Westernization, tattoos were banned by the Japanese government, who considered them uncivilized and old-fashioned. This ban was lifted after the American occupation after WWII.)\"It is uncertain whether Kuniyoshi was responding to a recent craze for extensive pictorial tattoos, or whether -- as suggested by oral tradition among present-day tattoo artists -- it was the prints themselves that inspired the new fashion,\" Thompson writes.\"Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between: large tattoos were already beginning to appear, but it was Kuniyoshi who transformed a temporary fad into a lasting art form.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/style/article/tattoos-in-japanese-prints/index.html"}, {"title": "The naked truth", "data_published": "2017-03-31T12:35:44Z", "content": "(CNN) Behind the double-mastectomy scars that run across her bare chest, she had a story to tell.So late last April, Paulette Leaphart embarked on a 1,000-mile walk from her childhood hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi, to the halls of Congress in Washington.And she did it topless.The breast cancer survivor screamed for a cure and demanded better and more affordable health care. She wanted women without breasts to believe in their beauty and be proud of their strength. By showcasing and embracing her scars, she hoped to inspire others to do the same.Her journey was bold, visual, moving. It offered a hero to admire and, given Paulettes audacious decision to walk shirtless in the face of strangers, a rich spectacle to witness. It spoke to African-American women, who face the highest breast cancer mortality rate. It inspired legions of survivors. And it spoke to many whod lost someone to the disease.It seemed a storytellers dream. But reality would eventually intrude.Documentary filmmakers were first to seize on Paulettes potential -- after she approached a producer who was out on a shoot, lifted up her shirt and said her story needed to be told. A stunning trailer for \"Scar Story,\" in which the film crew would follow her entire walk, was released in late October 2015.A Kickstarter campaign to help fund the film went up weeks before the walk began, attracting enthusiastic donors. Journalists flocked to Paulette, eager to tell her story. Even megastar Beyoncé took notice and featured Paulette in \"Lemonade.\"I saw the trailer on Facebook and, like so many others, was hooked. In a world hungry for heroes, whose stories of inspiration bring us light amid darkness, Paulette seemed to feed that craving. After making a few calls and learning she was walking with her 8-year-old daughter, no less, I hopped in my car, picked up my amateur photographer stepson, and headed to North Carolina to walk with her.Some stories land on a journalists plate like manna from heaven. Theyre perfect morsels you cant wait to share. Others arrive a mess of ingredients with no recipe to follow. This one started the first way and finished the other.After walking with Paulette for a full day, I left with more questions than answers. No matter how much I hated to admit it, aspects of her story simply didnt add up. And the more I kept digging, the more inconsistencies I found: about her past and her cancer treatment, about how much she was actually walking, even about her motivations.Part of me wanted to walk away -- from Paulette and the story. If even one womans life was saved thanks to a conversation Paulette started, wasnt that enough? So what if our hero was flawed?But then I thought about the thousands of people following Paulette on Facebook, all the journalists who covered her journey and the online video viewed more than 20 million times.And I realized: This story wasnt just about Paulette. Its about our need to find -- and, for some of us, become -- heroes. Its about the unchecked storytelling and self-promotion that thrives on social media. Its about the disappointment we feel when reality jolts us awake from our reverie.In our desperation to believe in people, do we dole out passes too easily? Had we, in our collective enchantment with Paulette, all become blind?Shameka Fulston, left, and others join Paulette Leaphart for a community walk in Charlotte. Fulston planned to rejoin Paulette for the last 100 miles of her walk but left Charlotte feeling disenchanted.A vision from GodI caught up with Paulette at a house outside Charlotte, North Carolina, where she and her daughter were staying. The grill was fired up, food filled the counters and the music was pumping. Paulette, who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \"Living beautifully,\" greeted me with a hug.\"The walk has given me back everything the devil stole from me,\" she told those in the room, as they gathered to pray for her journey.The hostess said she opened her home because shed lost her own sister to breast cancer. As her tears fell, she told Paulette, \"Thats why I wanted to take care of you.\"Dusk turned to night, and I kept my eye on the time. When we spoke by phone, Paulette had warned me she woke up at 4:30 each morning and walked 20 to 40 miles each day except weekends, which were for rest. She had to cover that sort of ground, she explained, if she wanted to meet her goal of reaching Washington by June 27, her 50th birthday. Im in decent shape, but walking at least 20 miles on little sleep scared me.\"Oh, were not starting til 9 a.m. tomorrow,\" Paulette finally told me as the night wore on. A community walk was planned in downtown Charlotte. I breathed a sigh of relief.The next morning, the crowd was passionate but small -- about three dozen women, men and children. Many wore pink , and most had been touched by breast cancer.\"Five years in October,\" said one woman. \"Nine years cancer-free,\" said another, sporting a \"Fight Like a Girl\" T-shirt. \"Mom died in 2004,\" said one man, who survived lymphoma himself.A woman whod driven through the night to be here took off her shirt to reveal her own tangled scars. Shed seen Paulette in Atlanta and vowed to walk with her.After photos, videos and prayers, the walkers hit the pavement, weaving their way through downtown. \"We need a cure! We need a cure!\" they screamed, following Paulettes lead. \"Breast cancer sucks! Breast cancer sucks!\" They also sang hymns.\"We will walk until we defeat this demon!\" Paulette yelled.All the pain I felt from the day I was born had purpose, and Im living that purpose. God said Im going to use your chest. Paulette LeaphartIt was Memorial Day, one month to the day since she started, and the streets were quiet. Occasional onlookers gawked, wondering what the commotion was about. I walked along taking notes and wondered myself: How effective was this small, 1-mile march, really?I was more interested in what would come next: the walk she was resuming with her daughter to reach Washington in less than a month.They had already covered 710 miles. Theyd walked all but 100 of them, Paulette said. She said she often used cabs to carry her through dangerous parts of the journey. With most weekends off, that would mean theyd averaged more than 27 miles a day on foot.We got started around noon. Id pictured us rambling through rolling hills of green. Paulette would be like Forrest Gump, I thought, gathering disciples as she strode through quaint towns.Paulette preferred a busier route and steered us toward US 29. In her mind it was safer, and only along highways could she and her message be seen. She carried no sign, insisting the scars told her story.To her 5,000 friends and thousands more followers on Facebook, Paulette was already a hero. They showered her with love and praise.\"If I had 10,000 thousand tongues, I couldnt thank you enough,\" one person wrote the day after I walked with her. \"I understand your fight! God is with you every step of the way.\"\"I love you for what you are doing,\" wrote another. \"You are so brave you are my WOMAN OF THE YEAR.\"\"You are such a phenomenal woman,\" wrote a third. \"I lost my mother to breast cancer but I know if she were alive, she would be walking with you -- the whole way. ... God bless you.\"Paulette has inspired women all over the world and said she has even saved lives. People whod been considering suicide, she said, were motivated by her to go on.The global attention began two years earlier, when, over Labor Day weekend, she posted topless photos of herself on a beach in Mississippi. She had just emerged from eight months of depression after losing her breasts and being told she couldnt have reconstructive surgery because of a pre-existing blood-clotting disorder. She says she had a vision from God to go to Biloxi Beach, take off her shirt and be photographed.She said people surrounded her. A woman began to cry and then she did, too. Onlookers applauded. Paulette freed herself in that moment and, in posting photos on Facebook, did the same for others. She said a man wrote to thank her, saying that his wife, whod lost her breasts years before, had finally bared her chest for him.She was chosen by God to be a vessel for his work, she said, and her photos were \"liked\" almost 300,000 times. It was God who woke her up one night in December 2013 to tell her she had breast cancer, which doctors later confirmed. And it was God who told her to go on this 1,000-mile topless walk.\"All the pain I felt from the day I was born had purpose, and Im living that purpose,\" she said. \"God said Im going to use your chest.\"Pushing her daughter in a weighed-down stroller, Paulette Leaphart winds her way out of downtown Charlotte to continue her journey toward Washington.The first signsBased on the expressions of the people we passed, not everyone saw the purpose. She joked that she must look like a bag lady to some. Others got what this was about and offered her cheers and hugs. A church group giving out toiletries to homeless people gathered her in a circle for prayers. Two women on bikes whod seen her story rode up and passed her $20 bills.Paulette had said she only ate fruit when she walked. On this day, though, she ate fried chicken tenders from Popeyes and two hot dogs at Cook Out, a Southern fast-food chain. I wasnt judging her choices; I matched everything she ate and then some. But she didnt eat the apple I offered, and I never saw her eat a piece of fruit.It was one of those tiny, perhaps silly, observations I filed away. But arent we all guilty of saying and doing different things, especially when it comes to diet?The heat had slowed her down. She said she was now aiming for 20 miles a day, news that came as a relief. It was late afternoon, though, and we hadnt even gone 10 miles. Sometimes her daughter trudged along with us. More often, she climbed into a stroller built for kids less than half her size. Bags spilled over the sides; one balanced across her lap. Several times the awkward contraption tumbled over when she was getting in or out.While picking up her scattered belongings -- an overstuffed wallet, sunscreen and bug spray, water bottles and her daughters \"Jesus Storybook Bible\" -- Paulette told me shed already lost her drivers license and passport.\"How do you check into hotels?\" I asked, knowing desk clerks always ask for ID. \"Everyone knows who I am,\" she answered with a smile. I made another mental note.The highway we walked along grew busy. When Paulettes daughter was out of the stroller, I often caught myself holding my breath as cars whizzed by.In the hottest part of the day, she took breaks. Sometimes, she said, she and her daughter studied. Other times, they found a place to swim, catch a movie or visit a garden. On the day I walked with her, we went bowling.Paulette was on her phone often and obsessed with charging it wherever we stopped. She wasnt making calls as much as checking Facebook. She seemed consumed with monitoring likes, shares and comments. I asked if anyone on the Internet ever put her down.Only one, she said: a woman she didnt know who was spreading lies and had a criminal record. A woman she suspected was crazy and jealous. A woman she was determined to ignore.What about the documentary group whod set out to follow her? What had happened to them? Paulette told me theyd made money off her story without her consent and left after just a few days, abandoning her and her daughter \"like dogs on the side of the road.\"Paulette often described her undertaking as \"a walk of faith\" and said Jesus has always been with her. When she was a small child, she said, she was sexually, physically and emotionally abused. Her great-grandmother gave her a Bible. She said it was the first book she ever read.\"She couldnt protect me, but she gave me something that would.\"After one particularly brutal beating, Paulette said, she promised God that if he let her live, shed dedicate her life to taking care of children. She has eight; she said she gave birth to four and adopted four others. Over the years, she said, shes fostered hundreds more.Her older kids were caring for her teens during the walk, she said. Her youngest, whom she said she home schools, refused to be left behind. When Paulette was at her lowest point fighting cancer, she said, her daughter pushed her to battle on.\"There were days I wanted to stop breathing. Shed climb up into my bed and love all over me. Shed say, Mama, promise me youre going to beat cancer. I promised her and I kept it.\"The highway we walked along grew busy. When Paulettes daughter was out of the stroller, I often caught myself holding my breath as cars whizzed by. When the shoulder narrowed, Paulette simply walked on the road.\"I force them to respect me.\"Fear, she insisted, was nothing more than the devil. She said God would protect her and her daughter. I hoped God would also remember me.Salvation came for us in the form of a flat stroller tire. The weighed down contraption now moved like lead.Paulette had asked for help pushing it throughout the day, and I was happy to oblige in spurts. But now, unless she could fix it, this day looked done.An auto shop tried to help but couldnt. A taxi ride took us to the other side of an interstate.I left her at Cook Out and took an Uber back to my car. She planned to wait with her daughter for a ride back to the house where shed been staying. She had miles to make up, she said, and needed to get to Walmart to buy a new stroller so she could pick up where she left off first thing in the morning.Our day ended as the sun began to set. Wed logged less than 14 miles.The \"Scar Story\" trailer was widely shared on social media and gained the attention of journalists, as well as Beyoncé, who featured Paulette in \"Lemonade.\"Paulettes financial woesAs more local, national and international reporters told Paulettes story, my reservations mounted.One local TV reporter wrote online that Beyoncé had walked with Paulette, though it was later trimmed from the piece. Another referred to her as a social worker, a career that, up until this point, she hadnt mentioned to me. When Id asked Paulette what kind of work shed done, she only mentioned owning a successful day care center in Virginia -- which, she said, shed sold years before for a profit. She became homeless, she said, when medical expenses mounted from two years of cancer treatment. She had to choose between having a roof over her head or fighting to get well.I wondered how many of these journalists actually spent a full day with her; besides the filmmakers, Paulette had told me I was the first. Was I a horrible person for not buying her story wholesale?I know were all vulnerable in this time of Internet hoaxes and fake news. Remember the recent story of a Santa Claus in Tennessee who claimed an ailing 5-year-old boy died in his arms? The world went nuts over this tearjerker, the story went viral, and none of it was publicly corroborated by anyone other than Santa.I got teary-eyed when I saw Santas story, and when I first learned about Paulettes I was similarly taken. Its who I am as a person; I want to believe. But as a journalist my job is to ask questions and pull on those loose threads of doubt. So I enlisted a CNN researcher to pull up a background report on Paulette.Thats when her story began to unravel.She found a way for people to feel sorry for her, a way to collect money and notoriety. Barbara Smith, who won part of a $100,000 judgment against PauletteIt turns out her financial struggles long predated cancer. Years before Paulette said God woke her up to say she had breast cancer, thered been more than a half dozen civil judgments and liens against her totaling well over $100,000. Shed filed for bankruptcy, owed the IRS about $45,000 and had faced multiple evictions.The bulk of the civil judgments stemmed from the Virginia day care center, which Paulette had owned for less than two years. I spoke to Barbara Smith, who said she and a friend were bilked out of more than $60,000 after Paulette persuaded them to invest in the day care center and become her partners. They agreed that Smith and the friend, who knew Paulette from church, would later take over the business from Paulette, which she had valued at $200,000. But shed been dishonest about the state of her day care center, was in the hole and hadnt even been paying rent on the building, Smith said. The pair lost everything they gave Paulette.\"We were investing in something that wasnt even there,\" said Smith, who admitted they were too trusting. \"She just kind of shrugged it off as if we knew what we were getting into.\"Court documents show that Paulette had defaulted on her lease and had \"fraudulently represented\" the worth of her business. Paulette \"declined to cooperate with her counsel and failed to appear for trial,\" the court order read.The plaintiffs were awarded more than $100,000, but they \"never saw a red cent,\" Smith said. Paulette filed for bankruptcy a few days later.When media reports about Paulettes 1,000-mile walk began appearing, Smith said she and her friend were only temporarily surprised. Knowing her the way they did, this was just another \"newfangled idea of how to get money,\" Smith said.\"She found a way for people to feel sorry for her, a way to collect money and notoriety.\"Paulette Leaphart captured the attention of young documentary filmmakers when she approached a producer, lifted up her shirt and said her story needed to be told.A day with BeyoncéIt became clear, as I ambled along with her, that Paulette possessed an inflated sense of her fame.She told me she imagined having her own reality TV show and a movie deal by the time her walk was over. She envisioned a career doing motivational speaking across the globe.She spoke about Beyoncé as if they were friends and said the star had spent a whole day alone with her on the set of \"Lemonade.\" She said Beyoncé wanted her daughter, Blue Ivy, to look up to women like her. She said Beyoncé had promised to walk with her for a mile.I reached out a number of times to Beyoncés publicist to ask about their relationship but never got a response.Paulette predicted that by the time she arrived in Washington, thousands of women would join her. She said shed been invited to walk in places as far-flung as Kenya and Jamaica and that she was a hero in Israel.These seemingly over-the-top statements only made me question her further.I knew she was struggling, and I worried about her. ... Part of me wanted to close the book on this story, leave it unwritten and move on.I followed her daily on Facebook to see where she was and what shed do or say next. Five days after I left her, she posted a picture of the stroller with the flat tire. The next day she posted a picture Id seen her take with a man outside Charlotte. She was supposed to be nearing Durham at this point, around 150 miles away from where we said goodbye, and I couldnt help but wonder why she was still sharing shots from nearly a week earlier. I learned that she stayed in the house where I met her for five nights total -- two after we parted ways. After that, she seemed to take as many days off as she walked.She visited with relatives and girlfriends and frolicked on a beach. She fell sick and rested. She phoned to tell me about circulation problems in her feet and cried about being bullied online. She put her walk on hold to travel up to Washington to attend The United State of Women Summit, hosted by first lady Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey, but didnt stay. The next day she posted photos of herself in a hospital bed, saying she was dehydrated.I knew she was struggling, and I worried about her. I suspected the attention had derailed her initial mission, that shed gotten in deeper than she could handle. I wondered if she was surrounded by people who no longer cared about her best interests. I feared there might be something bigger going on with her, that she might have other issues. Part of me wanted to close the book on this story, leave it unwritten and move on. Her journey now felt tragic and sad. What purpose would outing her discrepancies serve?But I kept reminding myself Paulette put herself in the spotlight. Millions of people subscribed to her story, including plenty of journalists. Beyond notoriety, what else was she after? How was she affecting others? Maybe there was something to gain from digging deeper -- for all of us.The trailer for \"Scar Story,\" a proposed documentary about Paulette Leapharts 1,000-mile walk, was filmed in New Orleans, where Paulette lives.Looking for directionPart of what kept me going was what I learned about the documentary.The filmmakers told me theyd spent seven months preparing for this venture. They said Paulette had signed off on the trailer and Kickstarter page and had been told time and again that the film crews intention was to simply document her journey.They thought theyd made it clear to Paulette that she would be responsible for her personal arrangements, logistics, support system and finances. As the departure date approached, they said, they kept checking to make sure her plans were on schedule. Paulette assured them she was ready.The day they set out, the filmmakers learned that her plan was to lean on them. Director Emily MacKenzie said Paulette turned to her and asked, \"Which way should I go?\"\"My heart sank,\" MacKenzie told me. \"In that moment when she said that, I felt betrayed and deeply worried.\"Paulette also insisted on bringing her daughter. The filmmakers had expressed concerns about this in earlier conversations. How would Paulette walk and care for her at the same time? She insisted she could handle it.They agreed to help out in small ways; theyd gladly walk Paulettes daughter to the bathroom or make her a sandwich. But once the walk began, they said, Paulette wanted them to take on far more responsibility for her daughter than theyd discussed or agreed to -- and when they resisted, she grew furious.They had a film to make and couldnt be liable for the welfare of a child, they told her.I am sad to report that while we were with her on the road, the environment became hostile and unsafe for my team. Filmmaker Emily MacKenzieEverything about the walk now made them nervous. Paulette got horrible blisters, even though she said shed been training for more than a year. (Her explanation, on Facebook, was that shed only trained on flat ground.) They spent three days with her -- covering 17, 11 and 9 miles -- and all signs pointed to disaster. Paulette blamed them for not being prepared. Theyd put their lives on hold for a year for this project and were crushed, but felt they had no choice but to walk away.They worried about Paulette and her daughter, though. They said they offered to drive them home to New Orleans, where Paulette lives, or at least take her daughter to relatives. They were in contact with one of Paulettes cousins, who was also concerned. They only left when they were assured loved ones were on the way.Soon after their paths diverged, they said, Paulettes mileage seemed to quadruple. One day she boasted online about a full day of walking that, given the distance between her self-reported starting and stopping points, would have amounted to about 65 miles.Finally, in June, MacKenzie posted a letter on the films website on behalf of the team, telling supporters why the films focus had changed to feature other women. She chose her words carefully.\"I am sad to report that while we were with her on the road, the environment became hostile and unsafe for my team. We realized the distressing truth that the terms under which we had agreed to film the documentary were false and that we would be in a compromised and legally liable position to stay on the road any longer. In good conscience, I could not keep my crew on the road. Hence, we are not filming further with Paulette.\"The attacks from Paulettes supporters were almost immediate.Youre going to be arrested for this. God knows what you did! How could you leave a homeless woman?Someone reached out wondering how they could organize to buy Paulette a house. The filmmakers could only shake their heads. Theyd been in Paulettes home. They knew she wasnt homeless.When Paulette saw the letter she immediately threatened legal action, saying her lawyer would be in touch. The filmmakers never heard from an attorney.A frequent presence on Facebook, Paulette Leaphart is a big fan of selfies. She posts glamour shots of herself frequently.The A TeamAt a certain point, beyond fact-checking Paulettes background, I knew I had to look into her online critics. Thats when I learned about three women who call themselves The A Team. At the helm is Kimberly McCarty, Paulettes chief adversary, the woman Paulette said was spreading lies about her.Paulette initially said she didnt know McCarty. But McCarty said she and Paulette connected via Facebook five years ago, before Paulettes diagnosis. McCarty said Paulette insisted on taking her out for a nice birthday dinner, only to have forgotten her credit card. McCarty said she was forced to foot the bill for them both. McCarty said Paulette told her a movie was being made about her based on a book shed written and that R&B artist Fantasia was doing the soundtrack. When Paulette later revealed her breast cancer on Facebook, McCarty didnt buy it.Paulette later admitted shed met McCarty once, but she likes to point out that McCarty has a criminal record and cant be trusted. Its true: McCarty has been convicted of theft, forgery and false pretense -- which could certainly make her a questionable source and made me reticent about reaching out to her at all. But McCarty owns her past and doesnt deny making mistakes.McCarty has been on an obsessive mission to cast Paulette as a fraud. She has gone so far as to say Paulette never even had cancer, that her double mastectomy was elective after she tested positive for the BRCA gene (think Angelina Jolies preventive surgery). McCarty insisted her fight is less about Paulette and more about honoring those like her father whove battled cancer, and the friends shes lost to the disease. But McCarty, and some of the people who chime in on her posts, can be downright cruel. They have called Paulette names, mocked her appearance, poked fun at her weight.Whether or not McCarty can be trusted, her claims were enough to force me to hit pause. I needed to know, with certainty, that Paulette actually had cancer.Mixed in with selfies, Paulette Leaphart often added shots of herself in hospital beds or otherwise struggling. She asked for prayers and got them by the hundreds.15 pages of medical recordsPaulette, at first, welcomed the chance to clear this up. With me on the line, she called one of her doctors and requested that her medical records be faxed to her. What she didnt tell the receptionist was that she was giving them my fax number. And thats how I learned that Paulette did, in fact, have a 0.7 cm cancerous tumor in her right breast, and that one of six sentinel lymph nodes removed from her right side also tested positive for cancer.Sometimes, though, when Paulette shares her story, she talks about cancer in her left breast. The left breast was benign, the pathology report shows. She also has talked about her cancer metastasizing to other organs in her body. To be clear, this could have happened; we dont have all of Paulettes medical records, just those that were faxed to me.Still, I was confused. I asked Paulette for permission to talk to her doctor so I could get a better understanding of her disease and treatment. Whenever I asked for details about radiation, chemotherapy and medications, the information she shared was often vague. She said she requested that her oncologist talk to me, but when I called his office I was told shed made no such request and the doctor couldnt speak. When I told her this, she never followed up.So instead I enlisted a surgeon who specializes in breast surgical oncology to interpret the 15 pages of medical records I had.What I do know, based on the records Ive seen, is that Paulette had breast cancer in her right breast. Claims that she did not have cancer are lies.Paulettes 0.7 cm tumor is considered \"very, very small,\" according to the surgeon, who did not want to be named. A \"re-excision,\" after an initial lumpectomy, could have gotten the slight margin of cancer cells left behind, the surgeon said. Instead, Paulette opted for a double mastectomy.Paulette said she has a family history of cancer, so such an aggressive approach can be understood, the surgeon said. Because one of the six lymph nodes removed tested positive, she had what doctors describe as stage 2a cancer. Based on what the surgeon saw, she couldnt say whether chemotherapy or radiation would have been necessary.It should also be noted there is no definitive course of treatment for breast cancer. Its a deeply personal decision a woman makes with her doctor.Perhaps Paulette had radiation and chemotherapy, as she told me and said on Facebook. But the records I received did not confirm this, and without talking to her oncologist -- something I needed her help to do -- I cant say with certainty that she did. And I certainly cant say Ive seen all her medical records.What I do know, based on the records Ive seen, is that Paulette had breast cancer in her right breast. Claims that she did not have cancer are lies.But exactly how her treatment played out beyond the double mastectomy remains unclear, as do details about how her cancer evolved.Members of The A Team have pulled together presentations , outlining frequent contradictions in Paulettes story. They have saved every post shes made on Facebook over the past several years and allow her to argue their case for them. Why was she bald before she started chemotherapy? How does she explain recycling identical photos to describe different doctor appointments? What happened to the cancer she once said was in her liver? How could she say pneumonia cleared her lungs of tumors? How did she walk 5 miles each way to doctors appointments when she claimed to be so sick?Katrina Adams is another member of The A Team. Her sympathy initially went out to Paulette. She followed her on Facebook and told her she was praying for her. But then she started seeing posts that left her baffled. One day Paulette would be languishing in a hospital bed, and the next shed be out shopping with her children. Then Adams own mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer, and Adams saw how chemo ravaged her body. How could Paulette be so active? She started watching more closely, found McCarty along the way and realized she wasnt alone in having doubts.\"I let it go for a while,\" Adams said. \"But then this walk came along and it sent me over the edge.\"Using a Facebook pseudonym, \"Marwin Jones,\" Adams also chronicled Paulettes posts and shared her outrage.\"How can you have heart & liver surgery, pneumonia, train to walk from MS to D.C., home school your children and move six times, all while battling stage 2 aggressive breast cancer that in your words Spread to your liver and lungs. Not to mention, you took breaks from the cancer treatment to travel for leisure,\" she posted in July. \"Who does that? This alone is enough to look at you with the side eye. \"Paulette Leaphart has been treated as a hero by many. She imagined having a reality TV show and movie deal by the end of her walk.From help to hesitationBeyond The A Team, there were others who initially supported Paulette and now have nothing to do with her. Among them were a seasoned public relations professional, a Washington insider with connections to a breast cancer foundation, and a best-selling erotic-fiction author and publisher known as Zane.An old trusted friend encouraged Zane to sit down with Paulette. Zane was happy to meet her and offer help, but it didnt take long for Zane to grow suspicious. As she described it, she saw the story change in the course of a day: One minute Paulette complained about how much she was paying for cancer medications, but when Zane proposed a way to get medications donated, Paulette said she was on disability and everything was covered, Zane said. When Paulette told her she owed doctors $200,000, someone Zane knew offered Paulette that money on the condition it go directly to the doctors. Paulette passed on the offer, Zane said, saying shed prefer to declare bankruptcy after the walk.Another friend of Zanes, with Marriott connections, reached out to Paulette to offer booklets of hotel vouchers so she could stay in rooms free during her walk. Paulette never responded.Despite all this, Zane said, she has no animosity for Paulette.\"It was just one of those things that once I became apprehensive I didnt want to be involved,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, I wish her well. I just couldnt be caught up in it.\"She made valid points a blind man could see. Carmen Lawrence, after reading Facebook posts critical of PauletteOne woman who did get caught up in it was Carmen Lawrence from Cleveland, who said she had been Facebook friends with Paulette for a few years.Shed followed her battle with cancer, pneumonia and other ailments. And when Paulette embarked on this ambitious walk, Lawrence wanted to help.Lawrence told me she took up a collection at work for Paulette. Although Paulette has a GoFundMe page for donations, which has raised $8,640 toward a goal of $100,000, she suggested Lawrence wire her money directly. Lawrence did. She sent Paulette \"well over $800,\" she said.But Lawrence grew wary. She didnt understand why Paulette was posting only parts of her walk. And when Paulette posted about being stalked by McCarty, Lawrence couldnt help but peek at McCartys page.\"She made valid points a blind man could see,\" Lawrence said.She reached out to Paulette to ask questions. How did she know McCarty? Why wasnt her walk recorded? Did she have cancer?\"I was blocked in minutes\" from her Facebook page, Lawrence said. In that moment, any trust she had in Paulette was lost.\"I was so into her story,\" Lawrence said. \"She hung herself.\"Paulette Leaphart was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 2014 but was unable to have reconstructive surgery because of a blood-clotting disorder.Family mattersPart of Paulettes story centers on when her cancer struck -- seven months after a first cousin, Monique McDonald, died of breast cancer.Paulette often said she moved to Mississippi in 2013 to care for Monique and her four daughters. I heard Paulette tell a crowd she was the only one who could set her cousin free; that Monique needed Paulette to tell her it was safe to let go and be with God, and only then did she peacefully pass.But Moniques mother and oldest child arent having it.As a little girl, Ashia McDonald, 22, was mesmerized by Paulette. She was the relative who got out of Biloxi, lived a glamorous life and seemed to have it all.When her mom got really sick, she said, Paulette began calling every day, promising shed send money and come help. She showed up the day Monique died, Ashia said, and told relatives shed been evicted from her home. Rather than arrive to help, Ashia said, Paulette was the one who needed help.Court documents confirm that Paulette failed to pay rent on a Lithia, Florida, home in May 2013. Her landlord threatened legal action in mid-May before filing for an eviction. Monique died on June 1.The family later learned Paulette had gone to area churches asking for donations for Moniques children, saying she was caring for them, Ashia said. Other than the $50 dorm fee Paulette offered when Ashia went to college that fall, she said she and her sisters -- who were in the custody of their grandmother, Brenda McDonald -- never saw this financial help.\"It tears me up because thats my sisters child,\" said McDonald, 59. She quit her job to care for her grandchildren, and she cries over the phone when she talks about Paulette.\"She took advantage of my grandkids. She took from them. She took their mothers death and ran with it.\"Ashia thinks back to her mothers packed funeral and remembers being struck by Paulettes demeanor. As mourners grieved and comforted one another, Ashia noticed something else in Paulette.\"She was so intrigued. ... There was no sympathy. There was no sadness. It was weird, like she wanted to be in my mothers shoes,\" Ashia said. \"It had everything to do with the crowd and the love. ... Im telling you, I knew she had something up her sleeve.\"Seven months after the funeral, Paulette was diagnosed with breast cancer.Sometimes my mom gives so much she gets hurt. Her intentions are always pure. Porsha Cummings, Paulettes oldest childAnother of Paulettes cousins, Candy McDonald, 29, told me of her own anger with Paulette. She, too, always looked up to her \"Auntie Paulette.\" But that ended after Candy said she signed a lease for Paulette, which she then skipped out on, hurting Candys credit, she said. Candy also says Paulette stole her beloved Yorkie named Suge.Paulette has had three marriages. The first lasted 16 years; the second, four years; the third fell apart in about a week, according to the three men.Her first husband, David McKenzie, said Paulette was a stay-at-home mom who often provided day care out of their home, and he -- a military man -- was frequently away. He read a few articles about Paulettes journey and worried about her walking along highways with a child but applauded her effort to raise awareness about cancer.He cant help but laugh a little, though, when he thinks about her setting out to trek 1,000 miles.\"I will say that its out of her character to walk that far,\" he said.The Paulette he knew didnt exercise and \"might walk down the street or around the block,\" he said. \"But life changes, seasons change and people change.\"The second man she married, Craig Leaphart, was hesitant to talk.\"I would say that her heart is in the right place and leave it at that,\" he said.He did add that shes had \"serious health issues\" and that \"her mom had breast cancer.\"I asked how he felt about his daughter walking with Paulette.\"I have no comment on that,\" he said, before hanging up.Her third husband, Sidney Williams, told me hed met Paulette on an online dating site right before her double mastectomy. She told him about her cancer, and he fell for her. Months after the double mastectomy, she moved in with him in Seattle, he said. When she told him she had to go to MD Anderson in Houston for cancer treatment, he suggested she stay in Seattle, and he took her to a cancer center there to discuss treatment. He walked into the room just as a doctor was telling her there was no sign of cancer, he said.\"She herded me out of the office at that point,\" he said.Williams interpreted this to mean shed never had cancer and said, in that moment, he felt like hed been \"suckered.\" He said he couldnt believe a word she said anymore and told her the marriage was over. He was heartbroken and disappointed but relieved to get out early.She told me she left him after overhearing him say, while she was in the throes of her cancer battle, \"I didnt marry her to watch her die.\"Williams said she stole his 2003 Jaguar and left the state. She told me she took his car, saying she drove it cross-country in spite of how sick she was. Williams said he never saw that car again.Paulette Leaphart carried no sign and insisted the scars across her chest told her story. She walked along busy roads, like US 29, saying this was how she could be best noticed.A daughters defensePorsha Cummings takes the criticism of Paulette personally. Cummings, 31, is Paulettes oldest child. The Fort Worth, Texas, hairstylist and mother of three girls talks about a mom who has always given to and thought of others.\"Sometimes my mom gives so much she gets hurt,\" Cummings said. \"Her intentions are always pure.\"A daughter from a relationship before Paulettes first marriage, Cummings said she grew up a \"military brat\" in a family that always lived a \"very affluent lifestyle.\" Her mother welcomed girls whod aged out of the foster system. She ran a day care center out of their home and cut deals for parents who couldnt afford the care. She took in foster children and paid for their private-school educations.So when Paulette called Cummings and told her she had cancer and was struggling financially, Cummings wanted to take care of her mother. She said she told her mom to come to Texas so she and her fiancé could help. But Paulette wouldnt have it.\"She wanted to put on a strong face for her children,\" Cummings remembered, and didnt want to burden anyone.Paulette didnt have insurance, Cummings said, and told her she had depleted her savings paying for chemo and other procedures, including $40,000 to remove her breasts. Cummings had been saving up for her wedding and insisted her mother take what she had.It crushed Cummings to think of her mom sleeping on an air mattress, facing outrageous medical bills and not having all shed been accustomed to. And then to see people say she was never sick with cancer? That just incensed Paulettes daughter.\"We know her story. We were there,\" Cummings said. \"Were just happy shes surviving and that shes thriving in her survival. ... Im proud to be her daughter.\"The trailer for a proposed documentary about Paulette Leaphart, which was later scrapped, showed her walking through her New Orleans neighborhood.Back with questionsThe next time I saw Paulette after I left her in Charlotte was in Washington. She had indeed reached the capital by June 27, her 50th birthday, crossing a bridge into the district on foot. A rally to welcome her was scheduled for a week later, after Congress was back in session.She was surprised to see me. Because I hadnt written about her yet, she said, \"I thought you kicked me to the curb.\" Her words reminded me of the cold description she offered about the documentary filmmakers, who she said left her and her daughter \"like dogs on the side of the road.\"Id come back to Paulette because I still had questions.Outside a church, a crowd of maybe 50 people gathered. Certainly not the thousands shed told me earlier would join her on her walk through D.C. Together, they would head to the Capitol for a rally. There were women who wept when they saw Paulette, some whod driven hours to be by her side. They marveled at her, calling her the strongest woman alive.Local reporters popped by to meet her. They filmed and gushed. I watched a cameraman turn teary-eyed while she spoke.Several women took off their shirts to reveal their own scars, something theyd never done before. I walked with one woman, her chest discolored by radiation burns, who almost didnt make it here because of ongoing pain. Women thanked Paulette and cried in her arms. Shed inspired them. She understood them and was like them. She was their hero.We walked 5 miles that day. I weighed in with those walking and -- once again -- began to fear I was being too hard on Paulette. So what if she hadnt literally walked all 1,000 miles? She was still making a difference. Who was I to question this power she had? Clearly, shed touched people who needed her.But then, as shed done before, Paulette got in her own way.She has a knack for saying more than she should. If she walked and spoke of cancer, womens health, her faith, it would be sufficient. But shes prone to hyperbole that gets her in trouble.They did the same thing to Jesus. Theyre going to have to kill me to stop me. Paulette LeaphartApropos of nothing we were discussing, she blurted out that \"Harry called\" and appeared shocked when I didnt immediately know who she was talking about.\"You dont know Harry?\" she said, eyebrows raised. It was Harry Connick Jr., I learned, and she said he wanted her on the premiere of his new show. When I followed up, a spokeswoman for the show told me a producer had been in touch with Paulette about her story but that she did not appear on the premiere, and was not scheduled to appear on any shows.I asked if Beyoncé ever showed up, and Paulette responded, \"No, shes really busy.\" And then she added with a coy smile, \"Were going to catch up later.\"I asked her about her work as a social worker, and she told me she single-handedly reformed the foster care system in the state of Virginia. When I said Id love to learn more about the program she developed, she told me to Google it. I asked if the program had a name and she couldnt give me one. I tried to confirm Paulettes story by calling the director of social services in the city where Paulette said she worked; despite leaving a dozen messages, I never heard back. The directors assistant said shed never heard of Paulette, despite starting there long before Paulette claims to have revolutionized the system.I wanted to know about Paulettes finances when cancer struck. She said shed been bringing in less than $5,000 a month between child support and half of an ex-husbands retirement money.In one breath, Paulette would say she made too much to qualify for Medicaid; in another shed talk about being homeless.I asked where she was when she lost everything, and she described giving up a house in Mississippi, as well as all her jewelry and her cars.\"Cars?\" I asked. She said she had three of them: two Mercedes and a Cadillac Escalade.I asked Paulette what she was raising the money for. Was it for a cause? Was it to help fund research to find a cure? She told me the money was only to cover her expenses.On Facebook she shared photos of people passing her money, including one in which a driver leaned across his passenger seat, waving a $100 bill.Her critics wondered if shes reporting any of the donations shes received -- whether online, by wire or in person -- and suggested people file complaints with the IRS.Paulettes supporters told me these critics were just \"trying to snuff out her light,\" as one put it. Paulette insists on Facebook that she loves her haters. She thinks about their efforts to tear her down and also says this: \"They did the same thing to Jesus. Theyre going to have to kill me to stop me.\"In some cities along the way, Paulette Leaphart was joined by others for community walks. This group in Charlotte sang hymns and chanted \"We need a cure\" and \"Breast cancer sucks.\"Addressing the crowdShe took the stage at a park near the Capitol like a rock star. \"Survivor\" by Destinys Child blared through speakers, and she implored people to dance.A couple of women whod driven in from eastern Pennsylvania sat on the sidelines, watching her in awe. \"She radiates,\" said one. \"I actually got to walk next to her!\" gushed the other.Paulette spoke about God sending her directly to a surgeon to remove her breasts. Some women answered with amens; others appeared troubled.\"Im pretty sure you have to go to an oncologist before you go to the surgeon,\" a woman whod lost one of her own breasts to cancer said to me later. This woman is a devout Catholic and doesnt doubt the power of God, but she said this part of Paulettes story sounded a little off to her.All day Id scanned the crowd looking for Shameka Fulston. She was the woman whod driven through the night from Atlanta to walk with Paulette in Charlotte and had bared her own scarred and breastless chest. She said back then she would walk the last 100 miles of Paulettes journey with her and join her in Washington, but she was nowhere to be seen.Im sort of sad this walk is over. If I kept walking, I could have a new house by the end of the year! Paulette Leaphart to a crowd of supporters outside the US CapitolI later called Fulston to see what became of her. She said several things about Paulette gave her pause in Charlotte. For one, she said Paulette grew annoyed, even angry, when she found out Fulston could have gotten reconstructive surgery but chose not to. Paulette told me she had picked out size D breast implants before doctors said reconstructive surgery was too dangerous.Fulston didnt want reconstructive surgery because her body had already been through enough, she said. Now, the person who preached that women should embrace their scars was making Fulston feel judged for hers. Then, Fulston said, when she asked what Paulette planned to petition Congress about, Paulette had no clear answer.\"I just dont like being a part of something that doesnt seem to have a lot of direction,\" Fulston said.Later, she was asked to fly up to Washington for a photo op with Paulette, Fulston said, and she balked. To travel for pictures seemed absurd and a waste of her time. She remains confused about what Paulette is fighting for.From a stage in the park outside the Capitol, Paulette looked out at her admirers. She said none of this walking was for the money. But then she boasted about the time she raised $1,200 in one day.\"Im sort of sad this walk is over,\" she told the crowd. \"If I kept walking, I could have a new house by the end of the year!\"Filmmakers spent seven months preparing to film Paulette Leapharts walk, but they walked away after only a few days. Paulette says she was abandoned; the filmmakers tell a different story.Blocked on FacebookAfter the walk Paulette went back to New Orleans and posted pictures of herself sitting on plush leather seats behind the steering wheel of what appeared to be a new Mercedes SUV.Paulette later told me shed be addressing a crowd of 40,000 people over Labor Day weekend. She gave me the name of the event -- I asked her to repeat it so I knew I had it right -- but I couldnt find any evidence of it ever existing. And on Labor Day weekend, this woman who consistently posted on Facebook multiple times a day said nothing about a speaking engagement.Paulette continued to say she wasnt out for fame and attention but kept sharing glamor shots and pictures from TV and film sets. She posted about her daughter now having an agent but did not respond when I texted to congratulate her and asked to learn more.She has since blocked me from her personal Facebook account.Its what she does when people ask questions, Ive been told time and again. One woman, after noticing Paulettes posts about her newfound fame and attention, simply asked her how she was paying it forward. She, too, got blocked.In November, Paulette posted a video in which she talked about a CNN reporter who had been on \"a witch hunt\" for six months. Shed been warned that I was working on a story -- \"a negative article,\" she said -- and shared what she felt after seeing me in Washington.\"Her eyes were dark,\" she told her followers. \"And I felt this spirit about her and it was very uncomfortable. ... My manager noticed something about her, too.\"(Her claims are) unfair to those women who truly endured those treatments to survive breast cancer. The exploitation ... has got to stop. Dr. Melanye Maclin, a Maryland dermatologistNot always beautifulLast fall, someone put me in touch with Dr. Melanye Maclin , a Maryland dermatologist who does research and has developed hair and skin care product lines.She has media and celebrity connections in the Washington area and says she was asked to help get Paulette publicity when she arrived in the nations capital at the end of her walk. Maclin had been watching Paulettes journey and was intrigued, so it was easy enough for her to make a couple of quick calls.She invited Paulette to her home for lunch, where they discussed a campaign Maclin wanted to launch for her skincare line. It was to be called \"Always Beautiful\" and would be about capturing a persons inner beauty. Paulette seemed the \"living example\" of the message, and \"Dr. Mac,\" as shes often called, imagined Paulette being the face of the campaign.A couple of friends, including a breast cancer surgeon, saw Maclins enthusiasm about Paulette and told her to be cautious. But she, like so many others, wanted to believe. So did her friend Chantay Savage, a recording artist whose remake of Gloria Gaynors \"I Will Survive\" went gold. Savages mother died of breast cancer, and she recorded a song, \"Always Beautiful,\" for Dr. Mac. The song was released on social media and featured Paulette in the video.The flood of negative remarks and accusations about Paulette was almost immediate. They took the doctor and Savage by surprise, and they yanked the video. They also began to look at what Paulettes critics were posting. In an email, Maclin reflected more on what shed seen on Paulettes Facebook page and heard from Paulette directly.\"She does not display hyperpigmentation from radiation or scars claimed from the multiple surgeries due to admitted liver and lung metastasis,\" Maclin wrote.The breast surgeon Id enlisted to look at the limited medical records I had about Paulette agreed that the photos show no obvious sign of radiation or additional surgeries, but also reserved judgment, saying some people are less likely to scar.But there was more from Maclin, who added, \"It was also bizarre that she told me that she did not do chemotherapy,\" contradicting the story she has told on social media.Her claims are \"unfair to those women who truly endured those treatments to survive breast cancer,\" Maclin said. \"The exploitation ... has got to stop.\"Paulette Leapharts walk stirred up a media frenzy. Her image and story appeared in print, online and across screens around the globe.The media and the messageOne leader in breast cancer activism, who didnt want to be named, encouraged me to think about Paulette in a different way. Yes, she may be prone to exaggeration and not entirely believable, but if she touches one person, if she inspires one woman to get a mammogram, isnt that a win? And, this activist added, Paulette largely speaks to a population that deserves attention.Black women are less likely to receive breast cancer diagnoses at an early stage than are white women, are more likely to receive a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (which means cancer cells dont have the receptors to respond to certain drugs and therapies) and have the lowest breast cancer survival rate of any ethnic or racial group, according to the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe difference in mortality rates can be attributed to the stage of diagnosis, tumor characteristics and issues such as obesity. But it is also influenced by levels of education and access to treatment and health insurance, a comprehensive American Cancer Society report says.Furthermore, Paulette has tapped into an audience that shares her faith.If women are taking notice and paying more attention to their breasts because of her, that may be all that matters. The message may be more important than the messenger.Theres no way to measure how much of a difference Paulette Leaphart made in shaping the conversation about cancer in this country.But then another activist, who also didnt want to be named, described Paulette as dangerous. This activist works with women with stage 4 metastatic cancer, women whose cancer has spread to other organs, usually the bones, brain, liver or lungs. Their survival rate is the lowest, and these women, this activist said, are facing the end.For a while, she followed Paulettes journey. Then, she said, she saw a Facebook post about a woman with stage 4 who Paulette said successfully prayed away her cancer.\"That was it for me,\" said the activist, who then unfriended Paulette. \"Does that mean my friends werent worthy of being saved?\"Others voiced concerns about her preying on peoples emotions and their wallets while standing on a pedestal for a cause that seemed undefined.I wondered if other journalists had faced doubts and hurdles; I wanted to hear their experiences covering Paulette.One newspaper reporter, on condition of anonymity, admitted to having had some misgivings but was on a tight deadline and being pushed to publish. Another piece was put out by someone who, it turned out, wasnt a journalist and didnt have the tools or obligation to check Paulettes story. What mattered most in this case, I was told, was giving voice to the struggles she represented.Other journalists I contacted didnt want to comment at all.Upworthy, a website for viral content, reached out to Emily MacKenzie, the documentary filmmaker, to see if she could vouch for Paulettes story. MacKenzie said she told them that, in good conscience, she could not and advised the site against sharing any videos of Paulette. The site did anyway, and one video it posted in June got more than 20 million views, which only prompted other outlets to tell Paulettes story.I reached out to people at Upworthy, including the vice president who MacKenzie said she spoke to, more than half a dozen times. I said I wanted to learn about their vetting process and the decision to share videos about Paulette. I never got a response.Paulette Leaphart appeared on TV and film sets after her walk ended and posted selfies with Will Smith and Scott Bakula.Hollywood sets and setbacksBefore she blocked me from seeing her Facebook page, I checked on her social media presence from time to time. The images were often a mixture of selfies and pictures of her posing, impeccably made up and modeling new clothes. She appeared on the sets of CBS \"NCIS: New Orleans\" and the upcoming movie \"Girls Trip,\" posting pictures with stars and mentioning names like Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith. She shared a shot with Scott Bakula on the \"NCIS\" set, and another with Will Smith, who was visiting the \"Girls Trip\" set. \"Will Smith heard about my story and came over to shake my hand,\" she wrote.Other photos showed her home in bed, giving two thumbs up from a gurney in an ambulance and in a hospital room bed. She pleaded for prayers and talked about pain and setbacks. At one point she feared she had kidney cancer and asked people to pray for her. It turned out to be a kidney stone. She worried a lump under her arm was the return of breast cancer, and supporters overwhelmed her with more prayers. It was a cyst.One day shed be listless under the covers; another shed be dolled up in clothes she said were created specifically for her. Shed stand beside people shed identify as her personal stylist, her fashion consultant, her makeup artist.We need this story. We need this woman before us. We need this woman and what she did on the tip of our tongues. Nikky Finney, poet and authorAt one point over the summer, she encouraged people to sign a petition for a proposed \"cancer relief bill\" written by a Michigan resident. But that push seemed sporadic.Since then, Ive used other Facebook accounts to keep tabs on her posts.Shes been the keynote speaker at a few events. She walked into turquoise waters while on a Caribbean cruise. She drove to Florida to receive, by her own account, $27,000 of dental work free of charge. In early October, she attended the espnW Women + Sports Summit in California. She was flown first class, put up in a posh resort and walked away with $400 in Adidas swag. She was also flown to ESPNs headquarters in December, where she was given the espnW Pegasus Award for Inspiration.An esteemed poet and author, Nikky Finney, took to the stage at the summit in California to share \"Topless in America,\" an original and powerful piece she wrote in Paulettes honor.I reached out to Finney to see if she was aware of the questions swirling around Paulettes story. She didnt respond.On her website , Finney calls Paulette her \"shero.\" She says she \"stopped me in my tracks and reminded me of what a woman is truly made of: Iron & Lavender.\"\"We need this story. We need this woman before us,\" Finney writes. \"We need this woman and what she did on the tip of our tongues.\"As the heat rolled in late last spring, Paulette Leaphart began to slow down. She said she hoped to walk 20 miles a day, rather than the up to 40 miles a day that she said shed walked previously.The real Paulette?What Paulette did should be on the tips of our tongues, but not because she deserves praise, others say.Annette Johnson of Beaumont, Texas, has known Paulette for several decades. She knows some of Paulettes relatives and attended the same church when they were both living in Mississippi.Paulette reached out to Johnson in October 2013, months after Johnson was diagnosed with breast cancer and Paulettes cousin, Monique McDonald, had died. This was a few months before Paulettes own diagnosis. Johnson said Paulette wanted to hear all about what she was going through.\"Then, all of a sudden, she came down with cancer,\" Johnson said. \"And I was really sympathetic.\"But as time went on, Johnson began to notice something strange. She said Paulettes Facebook posts began to mirror a little too closely the experiences Johnson had shared in phone conversations with Paulette.Johnson rattled off her dietary and workout regimens, only to see Paulette post them as if they were her own. She told Paulette she lost her hair after the first chemo treatment, and all of a sudden, she said, Paulette had shaved her head. She mentioned how she wasnt able to get a chemo treatment when her white blood cell count was too high. The same thing happened to Paulette. Johnson told her that during a workup, doctors found a spot on her liver. Paulettes doctors found one, too. Johnson made an unusual request of her doctors: that she be allowed to keep her chemo port when it was taken out; it had been her \"lifeline,\" she said. The next thing she knew, Paulette was boasting about keeping hers.\"Can you not have an original thought of your own?\" Johnson said she thought.To have your story pimped, played and punked by someone for their own selfish gain is a sin and a shame. Annette Johnson, a longtime acquaintance of PauletteAnd then there was this: She told Paulette she was marrying her long-lost love. Soon after, Johnson said, Paulette told her she was marrying her long-lost love, too. But Sidney Williams, Paulettes third husband and the supposed long-lost love, said the two had met online only months before.There were other things about Paulettes story that raised questions. When Johnson was in the throes of treatment, she felt good about herself if she could walk to the kitchen and back to bed. Yet here was Paulette driving cross-country in Williams car.\"You drove yourself back in the midst of treatment? I didnt drive for a year,\" Johnson remembered saying. \"How did you do that?\"\"I just did it,\" she recalled Paulette answering.Paulette took pictures of herself in emergency waiting rooms just about every week, Johnson said.Other Facebook posts showed Paulette bouncing around, going on vacations, just as she was claiming to be broke and deathly ill. And she was taking repeated breaks from her treatment, which made no sense to Johnson.Johnson could no longer believe her. Shed opened up, shared her pain, thought she was confiding in and bolstering a fellow survivor. She felt like shed been had, and was angry because shed defended Paulette to others.\"We share our stories to encourage another sister or brother who is going through the process. We open up and give our hearts,\" she said. \"To have your story pimped, played and punked by someone for their own selfish gain is a sin and a shame.\"What Paulette has done \"hurts me to the core,\" Johnson said. She said she wants the \"real Paulette\" to stand up. \"I encourage her to tell her own story.\"Last July, after arriving in Washington, Paulette Leaphart set out to lobby Congress. Her message, however, wasnt entirely clear.The devil on her backI reached out to a psychologist after reading her blog post about the \"psychology of hero worship.\" She told me everyone has access to 15 minutes -- and more -- of fame these days. To stand out, though, people have to \"up the ante and up the storytelling.\"In the case of Paulette, I cant help but believe she upped that ante to her own detriment.On December 13, then-President Barack Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, a $6.3 billion bill that includes $4.8 billion for medical research for cancer and other diseases.Paulette took to Facebook Live to talk about the good news. She said her phone had been \"blowing up\" with messages.\"Im trying not to cry,\" she said. \"But God said that there was going to be a cure, and he asked me to take that walk to talk to Congress and get their attention.\"I was there for the first two of her meetings on the Hill, along with an entourage of her children, some of her friends and fans, and a woman who says she is Paulettes manager. Paulette met with aides in both cases, though Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan came in at the very end of her meeting in his office and posed with her and others for pictures. She later posted Facebook pictures with Rep. Donald M. Payne Jr., D-New Jersey, and Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.Perhaps she grew more effective as her visits continued. But in the meetings I attended, Paulette didnt seem to understand that the people she was meeting with were on her side -- that they, too, want a cure for cancer and more affordable health care. Nor did she get how the legislative system works or which laws -- including the Affordable Care Act -- were already in place.She complained about insurance and pharmaceutical companies, talked about being a business owner for 20 years who then became homeless. She said she made $1 too much to qualify for food stamps. She said she had to pay $5,000 a month for her blood disorder treatments. I could only surmise that this was in addition to the $2,500 to $5,000 a month she often said she needed to pay for her cancer treatments.\"Youre preaching to the choir,\" an aide said. \"This congressman shares your concerns.\"He explained to her how the system works, how there needs to be a certain number of votes to pass bills, how she needs to lobby in her own district to effect change.Paulette listened and demanded: \"Whats more important than human life?\"This story wasnt just about Paulette. Its about our need to find -- and, for some of us, become -- heroes.Theres no way to measure how much of a difference Paulette Leaphart made in shaping the conversation about cancer in this country. She touched many minds and hearts, but whether she did so in the most honest and transparent way remains questionable.The day after Christmas, she posted a new photo from a hospital bed. She complained of excruciating pain and revealed there was a new mass, this time next to her right ovary. My stomach dropped for her. She asked for prayers, and they came in by the hundreds.Then, in less than 24 hours, her longtime critic Kimberly McCarty shared an old post that questioned whether Paulette still had her ovaries. In the post, one of Paulettes daughters wrote that her mothers ovaries were being removed out of fear that the hormones produced by them were feeding her breast cancer. And, once again, I no longer knew what to believe or feel.Then came Facebook photos from Paulette. In one she was getting a vaginal ultrasound. In another, she was flashing the victory sign with her fingers and smiling as she was being pushed into an MRI machine. She posed next to the doctor who, she said, had just removed her ovaries. There was no cancer, she later reported.In the weeks before publishing this story, I set out to give Paulette a chance to address questions I still had and to respond to accusations made by others. I emailed her twice detailing my reporting and asking for answers about everything from her career and court judgments to her cancer and treatment. When I got no reply, I texted her and even had my editor send her a Facebook message. Then I called her. She indicated she had seen my questions and told me she didnt want to talk to me.Soon after my first email, Paulette thanked Jesus on Facebook for her \"brand spanking new house\" and shared a photograph of the home.\"I obeyed him,\" she said of God, \"even when the devil was riding my back.\"Days before we published this story, Paulette took to Facebook Live and said that about 25 years ago, after multiple suicide attempts and a nervous breakdown, she was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, formerly called multiple personality disorder. She said 10 years of therapy helped her integrate more than 20 personalities. She said she was going public with this after reading about the movie \"Split,\" by M. Night Shyamalan . Once more, I felt for her -- and wished I could know what to believe.Paulette likes to say that when life gave her lemons, she made lemonade. She adopted yellow as the color of her campaign and often says \"yellow is the new pink.\" She once mused out loud as we walked in North Carolina whether the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the embodiment of all things pink and cancer, would put out a hit on her for stealing attention from its organization.I dont think Ill ever know the full truth about Paulette. But the color that comes to mind when I think of her is neither yellow nor pink. Its the murkiest of grays.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/03/31/health/hfr-paulette-leaphart-naked-truth/index.html"}, {"title": "'Little Buddha' wisdom from a terminally ill 'goofball'", "data_published": "2017-07-05T08:03:25Z", "content": "Venice Beach, California (CNN) As a small child, she played hide-and-seek with nurses, ripped out IVs to race around the hospital floor naked and left an explosion of glitter in her wake.As a teen, she got boys to carry her uphill when she was tired, taught her best friend how to flirt and watched her doctor squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk.And as an adult, Claire Wineland has continued living out loud, even as her body fails her.Claire, 20, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic and terminal progressive disease thats landed her in the hospital for a quarter of her life. Ask whats on her bucket list, and shell say she doesnt have one.Fixating on a checklist of goals before she goes \"sounds exhausting,\" she says, especially \"when youve been dying your whole life.\" Instead, shed rather focus on doing all she can in each moment.Its a sort of wisdom that makes some describe this California free spirit as \"an old soul\" or \"a little Buddha.\"I meet Claire in a Venice Beach café; everyone who works there seems to know her. Shes on a mission to normalize sickness, push back at those who pity her and have a meaningful life for however long it lasts. Although she certainly has her down days -- \"Who doesnt?\" she notes -- this self-described \"goofball\" tackles life with humor and the sort of charisma that draws people to her.Claire Wineland smiles broadly at a comedy roast to raise money for Claires Place Foundation in July 2015.Still, she says, she must train people to feel comfortable around her.\"I cant just expect people to know what to say,\" she says, \"I have to make them see me as more than my illness.\"Shes been working at it on a number of fronts: In high school, she created a series of videos that went viral and penned pieces for national audiences, including one for CNN . Shes appeared in magazines, on television shows and at teen award ceremonies. Shes heading up a foundation, writing a book -- she promises its not \"another happy sick person book\" -- and packing in as much as her 5-foot-2, 95-pound frame can handle.Through it all, she gives public talks. On this day, thats at a TEDx event in Encinitas, a beachside community 100 miles south of her apartment in LAs Venice Beach.Wed arranged to take the train down for the event. But shed been fighting a fever as high as 103 the day before, the result of one of many infections her body continuously fights. When I offer to drive instead, she seems relieved. I am, too.Shes chatty and bubbly for most of the two-plus-hour trip, until she feels the fever coming back and curls up in the passenger seat for a nap. The only sound from her now is an occasional cough and the pumping of a portable oxygen concentrator, which gives her the air she needs without the burden of a tank. When I glance over, I spot a tattoo on her left ankle: the \"thumbs up\" logo from \"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,\" with the phrase \"DONT PANIC.\"But I start to do so when she wakes up and says her lungs feel \"funny.\" At the venue, she makes her way to the \"green room,\" where she sits, eyes closed, willing stomach pains to subside, trying to pull it together. Shes set to go on in 20 minutes, and Im afraid she wont make it.More than a sick kidShes been riveting audiences since she was 14, when she first stepped on a stage in a new ruffled dress. When I picked her up at her apartment, she wore faded black jeans and a black T-shirt that read \"Sexual Intellectual.\"\"Life is too short to not be yourself,\" she said.Ever since she was little, she found it strange how people treated her. Theyd peer down with sad eyes and say, \"Im so sorry.\" It was a statement she heard so often, it was hard not to internalize. And in a society consumed with being healthy, she grew confused.\"What happens when you have an illness where youre never going to be healthy?\" she asked. \"Does that mean Im never going to have a life? Am I never going to do anything or be anything other than a sick kid?\"Claire is one of 70,000 people worldwide, 30,000 in the United States alone, who live with cystic fibrosis, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates. To have the disease, both parents must be carriers of the CF gene. If they are, theres a one in four chance their children will be born with the disease.Cystic fibrosis leads to an overabundance of mucus, which blocks airways and traps infections in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, with time, causes respiratory failure.At last count, Claire says, shes had more than 30 surgeries. On a daily basis, she takes about four dozen medications, including self-administered shots for her CF-related diabetes, and might spend up to six hours on breathing treatments.She dons a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus, and uses a nebulizer to blow in steam and inhale medicines. She can cough up enough mucus each day to measure in cups. She gets admitted to the hospital for regular tuneups and intensive treatments.All the while, with her lung capacity diminished, her body works harder to breathe.\"Its like Im jogging 24/7,\" she said. She must consume as many as 5,000 calories a day to maintain her weight -- forget about gaining any.That explains the two large pastries she ordered for lunch when we met, and the French fries she got to go. And its why her younger sister, Elanore Nordquist, 13, used to get miffed whenever she wasnt allowed a second piece of cake but Claire could always have as much as she wanted.Even with this carte blanche for consumption, Claire takes in 2,000 calories through a feeding tube as she sleeps, while a machine helps her breathe so her body can rest.Pineapples and mushroomsClaire can laugh at the absurdities in her life. She tells stories of strangers whove approached her with unsolicited prescriptions for cures. The produce section of Whole Foods is ripe for material, she says. One shopper told her she simply needed to eat more pineapple. Another said all she required was a mushroom cleanse.And then there was the homeless guy outside a gas station who insisted that the mind can change reality and that she didnt need to be sick. She remembered thinking, with a laugh, \"If thats true, why are you homeless?\"But it was a friend who, when Claire was 11, changed her outlook by handing her a book he insisted she see.Claire has always welcomed chances to escape Los Angeles and breathe cleaner air. Here, she visits Vancouver, British Columbia, several years ago.It was Stephen Hawkings \"A Brief History of Time.\" The cosmology book blew her young and curious mind, and she rushed to the library to learn more about its author. Only then did she find out that Hawking had ALS, or Lou Gehrigs disease, and was terminally ill, too.Until that moment, Claire -- an avid reader -- had yet to find any role models, examples of sick people doing remarkable things.\"His body was completely failing, but he was contributing something incredible to society,\" she said. Hawkings diagnosis did not define him. \"He transcended it.\"In him, she found inspiration, though it would take a steep downturn for her to see her way up.FlatliningThe sicker a person with cystic fibrosis gets, the more work they need to do to stay relatively well -- and the harder it is to do that work. Its enough to make some \"CFers,\" as Claire calls them, stop trying.She gets it because she was once there.\"Its not that I wanted to die,\" she said. \"But I didnt know how to live.\"At 12, she feared that she was surviving just to survive.During a hospital stay, she had become close friends with Vanessa, another girl with cystic fibrosis. CFers arent supposed to be together, as they carry bacteria that can be deadly if shared. But these two girls connected at a safe distance, doing art projects across the room while wearing protective masks. They made disco balls for the nursing station out of crushed CDs and glue, shared an understanding and a sense of humor and, over the course of a year and a half, a deep friendship. And then, Vanessa died.Bereft and facing a lifetime of treatments, Claire asked herself, \"Why am I doing this?\"Claire and her sister, Elanore Nordquist, cuddle the night before Claire moves out of the house. One of the things Claire appreciates most about Elanore is that shes never treated Claire like a sick person.So she began to lie, saying she took her medications and treatments when she didnt. For a year, her health slipped, and she said no one could figure out why. Claire, whod always peppered her doctors and nurses with questions, knew the language and how to trick everyone.The day after her 13th birthday, a straightforward surgery to deal with acid reflux spiraled into chaos. She contracted a blood infection that attacked her lungs. She could feel them failing.As her oxygen levels plummeted, she began hallucinating. In a moment of clarity, she thought, \"I dont want to actually die. I want to see what happens in life. I want to see where it goes.\"She was placed in a medically induced coma, intubated and hooked up to an oscillator, a machine that gently puffed air into her fragile lungs. No child with CF had successfully come off an oscillator, doctors told her parents. Claire says she was given a 1% chance of survival. She flatlined twice.Her little sister was 6 at the time. Elanore remembers a social worker talking to her before she went in -- \"all sanitized and in a gown\" -- to see Claire.\"They told me to say goodbye,\" Elanore said. \"They told me shes probably not going to wake up. \"A winter wonderlandThere was no white light. Instead, Claire transported herself to a place shed never been: Alaska.Her subconscious journey began beneath ice water, she says. When she surfaced, she peered up at a mountain of snow. She sat amid ice-crystal-covered pine trees, floated on ice sheets while looking up at stars and hung out in a woodland house where animals streamed in to visit her.After her coma, Claire traveled to Sitka, Alaska, the place she believes she subconciously visited.Claire remained in a coma for more than two weeks. When she woke up, she learned that her dream world had unfolded while she had been submerged in an ice bath to bring down her fever.Though conscious again, she couldnt walk, sit up or hold silverware. She had to wear diapers. Her mom called her \"Grandpa,\" a memory that still makes her laugh.\"My body had no reserves left,\" she said. \"It was kaput.\"In the many months she worked to get stronger, she found renewed purpose.\"I feel like she had a spiritual experience,\" said her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager. \"She came out inspired to help others.\"Finding meaning by giving backClaire entered the world the way she lives: boldly.Yeager was overdue to give birth to her firstborn when a routine ultrasound morphed into a scene of terror.She watched the doctors face as he studied the screen. He ducked out and returned with another doctor. They told her that something was wrong with the baby and that Yeager had to be induced immediately.Claire was born with meconium ileus, a bowel obstruction that is a telltale sign of CF. Her bowel had ruptured, leaving her belly protruded, and she was whisked off for the first of many surgeries.\"The prognosis was five years,\" Yeager said, \"and that was a maybe.\"Claire spent the next seven weeks in neonatal intensive care. Her father, John Wineland, recalls peering down at his daughter as she screamed amid the medical equipment and tubes. Their eyes locked.\"Its going to be OK,\" he remembers telling her. \"Were in this together.\"Just like that, Claires parents, who then lived in Austin, Texas, were jolted from naiveté.Claire has spent a quarter of her life in the hospital, mostly at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in California, where her medical team is just like family.Raising a daughter with CF \"has consumed most of my attention, most of my life,\" said Yeager, who now lives in Seal Beach, California. She and Wineland, of Santa Monica, never married and decided to split when Claire was 3, but they remained close friends and have continued to tackle Claires care together.With Claire in the hospital two or three months a year, Yeager never felt that she could build a career. She lost a handful of jobs and quit others as hospital stays dictated. Shed take the day shifts with Claire while Wineland took nights. Hed hunker down next to Claire in the hospital, watch movies with her at 3 a.m. when she couldnt sleep, and head to work in the morning.All the while, Claires parents -- and, by extension, Claire -- were surrounded by friends. Theyd come to the hospital with meals, stick around when her parents couldnt, help rally the family and manage their lives. They also helped make Claire more outgoing and sociable, her dad says.Claire grew up knowing that she and her parents were fortunate, that too many families lacked the support they had. After waking from her 16-day coma, Claire proposed starting an organization to offer financial and emotional help to others navigating life with CF.Whether its covering rents, mortgages, insurance premiums or car payments, Claires Place Foundation aims to relieve pressure when CFers are hospitalized so families can focus on what matters most. Not long ago, it even helped find an apartment for a homeless CFer who was floating between shelters.What started as \"a side project to celebrate (Claires) life and survival became a passion of all of ours,\" said Yeager, who serves as the executive director.And for Claire, the foundation changed everything.\"All throughout my teenage years, I was able to hold on to the foundation as a means to remind me that I had value,\" she said. \"Its important for people who are sick to feel empowered. It gives them reason to take care of themselves.\"Dont touch her sushiIn high school, Claire launched The Clairity Project , a website offering insight into her life, including videos that became popular on YouTube.She offered honest talk with a smile about dying, life expectancy, even the perks of being sick. She gave tips on how to interact with sick people, answered questions shes often asked and introduced her family . She and her father, on guitar, performed together, singing Bob Dylans \"Knockin on Heavens Door.\"She stepped away from making videos after no longer seeing eye-to-eye with a production company that got involved. Instead, she decided to focus on what she could control and feel good about: the foundation and her speaking engagements.She also embarked on a new phase: Since graduating high school, shes lived on her own with a roommate in Venice Beach.A 2015 trip to Europe with childhood friend Alicia Schomer, who says Claire has changed her: \"Im not as terrifed of the thought of death anymore, but I am terrified of not living life to the fullest.\"It can be hard for any parent when a child leaves the nest, but for Claires mom, the transition has been even more fraught.Yeager knows how much work goes into Claires care and worries that her daughter wont ask for help.\"Im happy for her, and I know shes capable,\" her mother said. \"But I just see how sick shes getting.\"A year ago, Claire was at 50% lung capacity, Yeager says. Today, shes at 30%. She must take antibiotics to beat back recurring infections, which have become resistant to most of the drugs.And when she turned 18 and could decide for herself, Claire announced that she wasnt interested in being on the list for a double lung transplant.\"I had to be honest,\" she said. \"Its not for me and never has been.\"Though transplants can extend a life, theyre no cure. Shed have to live on steroids, which she hates taking. Shed run the risk of developing new issues when shes used to the ones she has. Plus, her body could reject the new lungs.\"And you cant eat sushi afterwards. Thats a no,\" quipped Claire, who says shed spend hundreds of dollars a month on sushi alone, if she could.Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the She insists that shes not giving up, though. Instead of opting for a transplant, shes holding out hope for a cure. If she got new lungs, she says, she wouldnt qualify for drugs in development.Therapies developed in trials are now helping many CFers, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , and eventually, with other clinical trials now underway, as many as 95% of CFers could benefit.Her decision was a blow to her parents. Theyve had to accept that she wont pursue an option that could give her another 10 years.\"Just think of it as insurance, even if you dont want to do it,\" her mom pleaded at first. \"Get on the list so you can change your mind.\"But Yeager, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her, knows to trust her daughters intuition.\"She has a relationship with her body that is sacred,\" explains her dad, who, like Claire, is a practicing Buddhist. Claires thinking, he said: \"This is the body I came in with. This is the body Im going out with.\"And as her father, \"I have to live with it.\"Claire, unpluggedClaire is Winelands only child. He says shes helped him become a better person.Hes learned \"to not be afraid of what hasnt happened yet\" and believes that Claire is exactly how shes supposed to be. Hes learned to \"love what is.\"At 51, he finds comfort in meditation and yoga, which Claire practiced for years, before her coma.Wineland is a life and relationship coach. Together, he and Claire have explored ways to grow spiritually. When Claire was 10, he says, she walked on fire at a retreat run by motivational speaker Tony Robbins. Hes had to figure out healthy ways to deal with pain, even to see the beauty in it.\"When you dont know whats going to happen to your only child,\" he says, \"it can be pretty debilitating.\"Claires parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split when Claire was 3 but remain close friends and partners when it comes to her care.Humor has also helped him cope. When theres a long line at a restaurant, he says, hell sometimes send her to the front of the line coughing to play \"the sick-kid card.\"Yeager too marvels at what Claires done for her. She says her daughters aura and energy lift those around her, making Claire \"a force of nature.\"During a recent hospital stay, mother and daughter were talking about death, a subject they dont shy away from.\"After you die, youre closer to everyone you love, because youre part of everything,\" Yeager remembers Claire saying. The words were a gift, a reminder that her daughters essence will remain always, even after shes gone.\"If and when it does happen,\" Yeager said, \"Im never going to forget her saying that.\"Elanore, Claires only sibling, is more no-nonsense. She never treated Claire differently, a fact Claire has always treasured.\"She couldnt care less that I was sick, which I loved,\" Claire says. \"It was refreshing.\"When she was younger, Elanore cared so little that sometimes shed even unplug Claires oxygen without telling anyone.\"We wrestled a lot,\" Claire remembers with a laugh. \"Shed unplug it to make me tired so she could win.\"She gets how sick Claire is today. Still, she doesnt see Claire as a sick person.\"Shes just a person,\" Elanore says. \"Shes not all-knowing. Shes still figuring it out, like a lot of people. ... She needs the freedom to be a 20-year-old.\"Its OK to feel painThough Claire had been attending Santa Monica College, part of her freedom meant putting school on hold.\"Truth be told, I probably wouldnt make it to graduation,\" she said. \"I feel my body changing, and I had to make an executive decision.\"Instead, shes focusing on what she can accomplish now -- including a new partnership with Zappos for Good to make hospitals more, well, hospitable. Shes designing the renovation and decoration of a playroom and intensive care rooms at the Childrens Hospital of Nevada at UMC in Las Vegas, which Zappos will pay for. The partnership began after Claire addressed about 2,000 people at the company in November.Calling her \"super inspiring,\" Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh said, \"Im pretty sure she brought tears to most of the people in the room.\"What her Zappos audience didnt know that day was how awful Claire felt.Over the past couple years, shes had more bad days than good. And in Claires world, that cant stop her. If she bowed out whenever she felt under the weather, she says, shed never accomplish a thing.Its like that again today as she sits in the green room in Encinitas, the TEDx audience awaiting her talk.The venue is a large meeting space behind a vegan restaurant. Attendees sip kombucha on tap and exchange hugs that last extra beats. When someone asks whether theres a yoga instructor in the room, they raise their hands en masse. Outside in the hallway are pieces of self-help literature, an announcement for a festival \"dedicated to the Divine Goddess\" and business cards for a spiritual medium.When I peek in on Claire, I grow worried. The room is dark, and her eyes are closed, her arms folded across her belly. I fight every protective instinct to whisk her off and take her home.Instead, she rallies.As the emcee introduces her, Claire stands tall, showing no sign of pain or discomfort. She strides toward the stage amid applause, her smile wide. If not for the pumping oxygen concentrator slung over her shoulder, strangers might not suspect that anythings wrong.She jumps in and talks about the fear she had when she first spoke publicly, the guilt she felt whenever she landed in the hospital, the isolation CFers often feel. She also speaks of what inspires her and her understanding that illness shouldnt stop anyone from living proudly.\"Its OK to feel pain and experience it,\" she says. \"Im not trying to fix myself. My suffering has given me so much.\"For about 18 minutes, she sets out to change how people think.When shes done, the crowd stands and applauds. Some audience members hoot and holler. As she weaves through the crowd toward the exit, I chase after her, overhearing whispers like, \"What a gem.\"Its clear people would like to talk to her, hug her, corner her for conversation. She shoots me a glance, though, that says, \"Lets get out of here.\"Claire has given all she can, and she knows shell pay a price.The priceIn the weeks that follow, Claire cant shake that infection. Then, in mid-June, an ambulance rushes her to the ER: Her fever is back at 103, her heart rate is at 185, and her white blood cell count is 30,000. Claires oxygen saturation levels are falling, a sign of lung failure.Not since the scare that landed her in a coma six years earlier has the situation felt so dire, her mother says.For a few days, Claire only gets worse. Shes transported to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where the staff feels like family. She has sepsis and a severe case of pneumonia and spends a week in intensive care. Doctors come close to putting her on a ventilator when one of the only two antibiotics that still work for her kick in.\"I thought this was it,\" Yeager says. \"It was an eye-opener for all of us.\"Its too early to know how much of a toll this setback will take on Claire, who is expected to head home from the hospital Wednesday.\"We think of Claire as invincible,\" her mother says, \"and this was a reminder.\"A reminder of how important it is to live each moment fully. A reminder of the lessons Claire still hopes to teach before its too late.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/claire-wineland-cystic-fibrosis-eprise/index.html"}, {"title": "Conjoined twins separated, both out of surgery", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights Conjoined twins Anias and Jadon McDonald were separated more than 16 hours into surgery New: After 27 hours, both twins are out of surgery and in intensive careNew York CNN —After 27 hours of surgery, twin boys Anias and Jadon McDonald – born joined at the head 13 months ago – began a new life apart on Friday.The round-the-clock operation at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx began Thursday morning and ended Friday. The separation procedure itself lasted 16 hours, followed by more hours of surgery to rebuild their skulls and make them whole.Jadon was the first of the boys to be finished. He was wheeled out of the operating room around 7:40 a.m. on a stretcher, his perfectly shaped head wrapped in white gauze.He was taken on an elevator to the pediatric intensive care unit on the 10th floor, where he was reunited with his parents, Nicole and Christian McDonald.“My boy,” Christian said with tears in his eyes.Nicole bent over in tears.More than five hours later, around 1 p.m., surgeons finished operating on Anias, and he was brought to the 10th floor unit – where the family was finally reunited.Photos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Krisanne Johnson/Verbatim for CNN Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

Prev NextThe surgery was led by Dr. James Goodrich, considered the leading expert on what’s known as craniopagus surgery.It marked the seventh and longest separation surgery performed by Goodrich – and just the 59th craniopagus separation surgery in the world since 1952.Nicole and Christian had to make an excruciating decision, opting for the procedure even though it carried major risks, including the possibility of death or long-term brain damage for one or both boys. But not to operate also carried risks: 80% of twins joined at the head die of medical complications by age 2 if not separated, studies show.Goodrich informed the family of the separation around 3 a.m.“Well, we did it,” Goodrich said.On her Facebook page, Nicole wrote: “TWO SEPARATE BABIES!!!…and yet I ache with the uncertainty of the future. I didn’t cry until the surgeons left the room. I was barely able to even utter the words ‘thank you’ because of the pit that still sits heavy in my stomach. We are standing on the brink of a vast unknown. The next few months will be critical in terms of recovery and we will not know for sure how Anias and Jadon are recovering for many weeks.”Dr Goodrich and his team just left. He walked in the room and plopped in the arm chair by the door. After 16 straight... Posted by Nicole McDonald on Friday, October 14, 2016The moment capped an end to an agonizing wait for the boys’ parents.The McDonalds and Montefiore hospital invited CNN to document this remarkable and rare journey of Jadon and Anias, allowing CNN exclusive access into the operating room throughout the procedure.Yet before Nicole and Christian learned their boys were now two individuals, Thursday was a day of high emotion and high stakes, of anxious parents and calm medical professionals. It was a day of uncharted territory and amazing, one-of-a-kind surgical activity.And amid it all were two infants – beautiful boys with deep brown eyes and a shared swirl of hair at the top of their foreheads. They came into the world together, and became two individual boys overnight.The parents worries extend beyond the surgery; they wonder what happens in recovery.Dr. Goodrich stands in Operating Room Number 10. It’s a drab off-white, and empty of people. Two operating tables sit in the middle of the room, abutted together. A 3D replica of the boys’ heads sits between them.’I feel good’It’s 6:52 a.m.The doctor began his day by skipping breakfast and enjoying a single cappuccino.It’s been 12 years since he last separated twins conjoined at the head at Montefiore. That was his first ever craniopagus surgery, and he’s learned much since then, performing five other separation surgeries around the world, including Syrian twins in Saudi Arabia earlier this year.Prior to the mid-1980s, it was accepted medical practice to sacrifice one child on the operating table to save the life of the other. Many times both babies died. If one child made it through surgery, he or she often suffered debilitating brain damage.Krisanne Johnson/Verbatim for CNN Dr. James T. Goodrich in his office at the Childrens Hospital at Montefiore.Goodrich has pioneered the field. He established the practice of performing the separation of craniopagus twins in several shorter stages, instead of one single operation lasting more than 50 hours. The McDonalds have had three previous operations, each resulting in progressively more separated brains. Today is the fourth and final stage. None of Goodrich’s conjoined twins have died during the operation. His mantra: “Take it easy and slowly and carefully.”His surgical cap embodies that philosophy: It’s decorated with turtles.“Don’t change what works,” he says. “Ready to go.”Within minutes, he and Dr. Oren Tepper – the plastic surgeon charged with reconstructing the boys’ skulls and stitching their heads back together – go to the 10th floor to a corner room where Jadon and Anias are resting with their family.The doctors exchange pleasantries with Mom, Dad and other family members who crowd the room. Asked how he’s feeling, Goodrich breaks out into a James Brown-like jig. “I feel good,” he croons.At 7:12 a.m., the boys are wheeled out of the room. Their older brother, Aza, lies with the twins on the stretcher as they’re taken down an elevator and through a phalanx of hallways toward the third floor operating room.“Open door,” Aza says.It’s time to say goodbye. Against his will, Aza is taken off the stretcher. “Babies, babies,” he says, reaching toward his brothers.Mom and Dad kiss their boys bye. “We’ll see our two boys later,” Christian tells Nicole.Nicole scoops up Aza and cradles him.

The boys share about an inch-and-a-half diameter of brain tissue.“This is what I wanted you to see,” Farinhas says, “which is something that is soft and you can actually poke in and cut through.”Goodrich studies it for a bit before saying, “Ready to rock ’n’ roll.”“Absolutely,” Farinhas says.“Failure is not an option,” Goodrich replies. It’s 7:22 a.m.For the next two hours, the boys are prepped for surgery. The place is a hub of activity, but of steely calm. The boys drift to sleep under anesthesia.At 9:27 a.m., plastic sheets are placed over their naked bodies, followed by blue surgical drapes. Moments later, their heads are wiped clean and Tepper takes a black marker and outlines incisions from the three previous surgeries.At 9:36 a.m., neurosurgery nurses Bindu Peter and Treshia Alex conduct what is known as a “timeout” – a required protocol before surgeries. They name both patients on the tables and the operations taking place this day, October 13, 2016.“We are doing craniopagus separation, fasciocutaneous scalp flaps, removal of expander, cranioplasty with bone graft, possible skin graft or use skin substitute, adjacent tissue transfer scalp, possible insertion of tissue expanders, possible insertion of wound closure device,” Peter says.“Correct.”More than 20 people in the room – surgeons, doctors, nurses, staff – say their names and titles.“How long will the case take?” says Peter.Goodrich: “Long.”“Any patient-specific concerns?” the nurse asks.“Bleeding,” one voice says.“We have cross-matched two units of blood. It is in the blood bank,” Peter responds.“Correct,” Goodrich.There’s some small talk, then Goodrich motions with his hands to Peter, as if to say you’re forgetting something. “Final line?” he says.“May the surgeon do a wonderful job,” one doctor says.Others chime with “A wonderful job!” and “Good luck!”Goodrich flashes a thumbs up: “Thank you.”It’s time to operate.

He and Nicole spend more than an hour writing personal notes to their closest friends and family for helping them get this far.The family holes up in the Caregiver Support Center, two floors and two corridors away from the operating room. Shortly after CNN’s first story about the family appears Thursday morning, Nicole and Christian start getting swamped with messages from friends and strangers alike. They monitor the hashtag #JadonAndAnias and watch as thousands of dollars in donations pour into their GoFundMe page.They’re buoyed by the messages of support from people as far away as the Philippines and Germany. They say their faith is renewed in mankind – that it’s a nice break from sordid headlines and the hotly contested political season.Humanity wins.“Everybody is really showing how much they love these boys,” Christian says. “I didn’t realize how many people out there have so much good in them and how much they want to help.”Were getting exclusive access to a rare surgery that will separate two brothers conjoined at the head. Dr. Sanjay Gupta... Posted by CNN on Thursday, October 13, 2016Nicole had quit her job as a pediatric physical therapist to care for the twins. She reads notes from mothers whose children she once cared for, including one who nicknamed her “Miracle Worker.” On her Facebook page, that mother writes, “Nicole is a Miracle Worker and now we’re seeing miracles worked in her life.”“They’re all just so heartfelt,” Nicole says.By noon, the surgical team has taken out one tissue expander and removed some temporary plates that were inserted in the earlier surgeries to hold bone back.At 12:04 p.m., it’s time to turn the boys to get to a new area to cut – a delicate maneuver that requires all hands on deck.“1, 2, 3, lift!” a team member says.Jadon’s shoulders rotate 45 degrees. They adjust Anias into a similar position. Tepper remains calm, continuing his work.Goodrich stands and turns away from the table. He grabs a nearby 3D replica of the boys’ conjoined skulls. A wine connoisseur, he studies it, mulls it over like a fine chardonnay. He’s facing two large screen televisions. One shows a live view of the surgery going on behind him. The other provides images of three-dimensional computer models of the boys’ veins, arteries and other brain matter.Soon, Goodrich returns to the table. Working diligently with him is Tepper and three other surgeons: Dr. Rani Nasser and Dr. Ajit Jada, both chief residents of neurosurgery, and Dr. Carrie Stern, senior resident of plastic surgery.The high-pitched sounds of tiny cutting instruments pierce the air. A smell, not unlike that of having a cavity filled at the dentist’s office, permeates all around.At 1:55 p.m, more than four hours into the surgery, Goodrich turns around and says, “The easiest part is done.”Fifteen minutes later, a chunk of skull is removed. No time to rest. The surgical team presses on. They take out a second tissue expander shortly before 3 p.m.Soon after, Goodrich sneaks off for two slices of pizza in a quiet, secluded room in the hospital. Nineteen minutes later, he heads back to the operating room.’Land of the unknown’Nicole and Christian bide their time with family. Aza bounces off the walls. Grandparents and others pitch in to keep the 3-year-old from driving their mom and dad too crazy.Mom enjoys the distraction. They get occasional updates on the surgery from a nurse practitioner for pediatric neurosurgery. Christian wishes they’d get more news on how it’s going.The family members wear white T-shirts Nicole designed. The front of the shirt says Anias with its Hebrew meaning, “God has answered,” and Jadon, “God has heard.” An infinity sign – often used as a symbol for conjoined twins – goes across the middle.Nicole made the shirts to try to raise a few bucks. Soon, she had 200 orders. The family ended up selling 1,000.“I’m gonna hug my wife,” Christian says, pulling her tight and holding her.The time now is 4:46 p.m.The day has been a whirlwind since saying goodbye to the boys nine hours earlier.Nicole had never even posted a photograph depicting the boys as conjoined until a month ago.She always took tight shots of each boy’s face to show them as individuals. But she knew she wanted to speak to CNN and needed to be brave to “better prepare myself for exposing my children to the world.”So, she posted one photo of the boys conjoined on Facebook and then another on her GoFundMe page. “I said, ‘OK, I’m getting real brave.’”“The response was beautiful,” she says.And now, this day, her boys’ day of separation – a symbolic “second birthday” – the outpouring of love has been awesome.“The babies steal the show,” Christian says.Nicole: “It’s their eyes.”“We would have it no other way, though,” Christian responds.It’s now past 5 p.m. As the day progresses, they know their anxiety will intensify. Their boys have gone through the three prior surgeries, and they know the doctors are still making their way through basically undoing those three surgeries before going into the final separation phase.“I call it the land of the unknown,” Nicole says.Yet their worries extend beyond their boys surviving today. They wonder what happens with recovery. Will they have seizures? Will they suffer heart failure? How long will they be in intensive care?Despite their worries, Nicole says, “When we sent them off this morning, to me, I felt at peace with it and just ready to handle what comes after.”Courtesy McDonald family Dr. Goodrich and Nicole McDonald with the twins before surgery.The most critical phaseShortly before 9 p.m., the operating room intensifies. The surgeons have reached their most critical phase: They must separate the shared blood vessels between the two boys. Veins are very thin walled, and one section of Jadon and Anias’ brains are intricately tied together, much more so than originally believed.A single cut that goes too deep can lead to catastrophic bleeding.Neuroradiologist Joaquim Farinhas stands in front of the screen displaying the 3D computer model. He calls Dr. Ajit Jada over from the operating table and points at the cluster of veins. Farinhas dispenses advice. Jada returns to the table.“Be very gentle with Anias’ side,” Farinhas calls out to the surgical team.Tepper, who had taken a brief break, returns to the table.“It’s a bear,” says Farinhas.“This is the most important part,” he explains, “because the vessels are so delicate and they’re so complicated. It’s almost a lake of veins that they’re trying to negotiate. It’s pretty amazing.”The surgical team has to figure out: How do you tie it off safely? How do you separate it? Should we proceed?At 9:18 p.m., Goodrich says, “We just closed off the sagittal sinus.”“That chardonnay is on the way,” quips Farinhas.A note of levity amid the intensity.The last stitchSeconds tick off into minutes, which turn into hours.The surgery is meticulous, tricky, complex. And that’s an understatement.At 1:18 a.m., Tepper, the plastic surgeon, steps to a nearby metallic table and takes a special saw to split a removed skull piece into two. Those two pieces will be used for the boys’ new skullcaps.Goodrich and his team continue to work away toward the moment of separation. At about 1:40 a.m., he sits in a seat next to the operating table with hands crossed, as if admiring the work. Moments later, he stands and dives right back into surgery.At 2:10 a.m., Goodrich says, “One more inch.”“We’re ready. You ready?” one surgeon says.“Yep,” Goodrich says.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.It’s a badge of honor as to who gets the last cut when separating conjoined twins.“The last stitch,” Tepper says. “Who wants it?”The only woman surgeon at the table, Dr. Carrie Stern, makes the historic last cut, at 2:11 a.m.“We are official,” Goodrich says.The room bursts into spontaneous applause.After nearly 16½ hours, the boys are separated.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/10/14/health/conjoined-twins-separation-surgery/index.html"}, {"title": "The guru's gift: Staying calm in a world of chaos", "data_published": "2017-07-19T08:09:01Z", "content": "New York (CNN) They arrive by the hundreds, walking through metal detectors, placing their belongings on conveyor belts to be X-rayed.Theyre passing through intense security in search of serenity.Its a warm New York evening, and these seekers are streaming onto the North Lawn of UN Headquarters to take part in the International Day of Yoga, a mass celebration of a discipline believed to date back thousands of years.Among them are seasoned yogis in matching outfits who stand on their heads to relax.

Its rhythmic and intimate, beautiful and heartbreaking. Lesli squeals as her mother holds her right hand and pats her left.A smile starts to radiate from Leslis face.\"Looka there,\" Dortha says. \"Are you going to smile? Can you smile? Theres that smile!\"Ever since Lesli was born 48 years ago, Dortha has longed to hear her daughter say a single word. She cried more tears than anyone can imagine, rocking young Lesli every night for years on end. Mom would get maybe an hour or two of sleep before heading off to her teaching job.\"Because you just care so much,\" Dortha says.Dortha contracted rubella when she was 2½ weeks pregnant, before she even knew that she was expecting. Although she got better, the virus took root in her fetus bone cells, nerve cells and skin cells. It would leave Lesli blind, deaf and severely brain-damaged. She spent 100 days in the hospital before her first birthday and has undergone more than 20 surgeries over the years, including an open-heart operation at 3 months that left her ribs broken.Lesli has lived in a Houston-area group home since 2000. Dortha, 77, now lives in Oklahoma and visits as often as she can, about eight times a year. As the two hold hands, Dortha ponders whether her daughter knows who she is.\"I dont think shes aware that Im her mother,\" she says. \"I think she is aware that Im someone special who cares about her.\"Dortha Biggs rubs her daughters hands, the only means they have of communicating.Its been a grueling journey for both. Mom yearns for the one thing that is unattainable: for Lesli to get better or just to enjoy the simplicities of life. Lesli lives in a dark, silent, isolated world in her group home, unable to communicate with her mother beyond touch.Four decades earlier, mother and daughter made headlines when the Texas Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling. Dortha had sued her doctor, accusing him of failing to diagnose the rubella. If shed known, she would have had an abortion.On February 19, 1975 -- three years after Roe v. Wade -- about 60 women filed into the Supreme Court chamber in unison and took up seats in support of Dorthas case. The women heard a decision that stunned the legal community and reversed lower court rulings that had sided with the doctor.The high courts ruling set a precedent that said a woman could sue her doctor for a \"wrongful birth.\"Dortha, who stayed home, learned of the ruling through the news.This year, the news brought Dortha another shock: A Texas state senator had introduced a bill that would ban such lawsuits -- in essence, overturning the precedent she helped set. And he invoked her case, saying wrongful birth lawsuits such as hers promoted abortion.\"The presence of a disability in a child should not be grounds for a lawsuit,\" Sen. Brandon Creighton told his colleagues. \"It sends the message that there are births that are wrongful. There are no wrongful births.\"Dortha was outraged.Never once did a lawmaker reach out to her. Never was she asked to testify in committee hearings. Never did they ask about Lesli.If they had, she would have told them of the pain her daughter has suffered since she was born March 8, 1969, in Wichita Falls, Texas. Of traveling more than 100,000 miles to hospitals in Dallas, Baltimore, Washington and San Francisco -- anything to give her little Lesli the best shot in life.\"If you have not watched your daughter suffer pain -- pain that was just hell -- for days and days,\" Dortha says, \"you cannot even grasp the pain that you experience.\"Shed have told those under the Capitol dome how she dedicated her life to special needs children for more than 30 years. Of designing the curriculum for disabled children in public schools, first in Dallas and then in Wichita Falls.Leslis portrait hangs on the wall at the group home where she lives.Tormented by the virus that wrecked her child, she wrote her masters thesis on rubella and its devastating effects in pregnancy.Many nights, Dortha weeps.\"I would have given anything to have never been born,\" she says. \"Because had I not been born, she would not have been born and suffered this.\"A legal legacyDortha is like a hawk, making sure Leslis hair is cut short so she wont yank it out, checking to make sure her wheelchair works and monitoring the cleanliness of her bedroom.The day after her visit, a scene reminiscent of the 1975 Texas Supreme Court ruling played out across the state in Austin.More than a dozen women dressed in long red robes and white bonnets sat in the chamber of the Texas Senate, their outfits matching characters from \"The Handmaids Tale,\" the popular dystopian novel that explores themes of power, gender and religion in politics.They were there to protest two anti-abortion measures, including the bill that would undo Dorthas legal legacy.Its a saga that began in the summer of 1968. Deposition transcripts tell the story:Dortha had fallen ill with \"nausea, shivering attacks, cramping of the stomach\" during a July Fourth trip with her husband to Port Aransas on the Texas coast.A pinpoint rash broke out across the top of her face and eventually extended \"downward to other portions\" of her body, including her legs.The possibility of being pregnant was the last thing on her mind. She was 28 and on birth control. She had a son and had planned to have a second child sometime down the road.She spoke by phone with Dr. Louis M. Theimer, the well-regarded family practitioner in Wichita Falls who opened his practice in 1953 and delivered hundreds, if not thousands, of the towns babies. Hed delivered Dorthas first child, Jake, on December 24, 1961.Theimer had seen her just before the trip. She wasnt feeling well then, but she told him she was feeling much worse now.Dortha and her husband of 32 years, Tom Biggs, visit Lesli as often as they can.She first saw a doctor in Port Aransas and was given antibiotics. When she returned home, she was still ill. She saw Theimer on July 11, 1968. He believed she might be pregnant and ran a test. She mentioned that she had a rash on her vacation but didnt ask about the possibility of rubella, also known as German measles -- at least not yet.Four days later, Dortha returned and was informed that she was indeed pregnant. She broke down, fearing that the rash was rubella and that her fetus would be harmed.It was the summer of 1968. A rubella epidemic had swept across the United States from 1963 to 1965. The diagnosis during pregnancy was a deep fear among any expectant mother, similar to how Zika took hold in Central and South America last summer. Rubella was known to cause deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness, seizures and extreme intellectual disabilities. If the mother got rubella in the first two months of pregnancy, it was known to be especially debilitating, continuing to live in the child long after birth.\"I was alarmed,\" Dortha testified. \"He told me the test was positive and I was pregnant.\"\"I said ... Could this rash that I had have been measles? And his statement was, No, if you hadnt had measles (as a child), you would have had them in the 64-65 epidemic. \"In his deposition, Theimer equivocated when asked about that conversation but acknowledged that he believed her rash was from an antibiotic, not rubella.Three times during her pregnancy, Dorthas body tried to spontaneously abort. Believing her child to be healthy, each time she agreed for shots to be administered to stop her contractions and save the fetus.\"After I was told I did not have rubella, I very definitely wanted the baby,\" she testified.And what would she have done if shed been informed that she had rubella?\"I would have done the kindest thing that I could have known to have done for her,\" Dortha said, \"and that would have been to terminate the pregnancy.\"Abortions were illegal in Texas at the time. She said she wouldve traveled to Colorado for the procedure.Theimer acknowledged that he never ran a test on Dortha to determine the presence of rubella antibodies. \"No, I never did,\" he said.Born blind, deaf and severely brain-damaged, Lesli Jacobs lives in a silent world.A Christian, the doctor said he had no religious scruples against abortion. He added that he would inform patients if he believed they have \"a possibility of having a deformed fetus.\"\"Thats what I tell them, but I think the choice after that is theirs,\" Theimer said.\"I agree with you. Thats the whole case,\" Dorthas attorney shot back. \"Doctor, did you give this patient of yours that choice medically?\"\"No,\" he said. \"I didnt think she ever had rubella.\"No right to judgeIts those words that still haunt, still sting. Time has not healed the wounds of the doctors misdiagnosis.\"Now, theyre punishing me again,\" she says of the legislation at the state Capitol.The fact that Creighton, the bills author, implied that people like her were just looking for a payout, she says, is \"beyond insulting.\" Creighton also argued that the mere threat of wrongful birth suits kept the best doctors from setting up practice in Texas and could lead to a shortage.To this, Dortha says, \"Despicable.\"\"It wouldve been nice if theyd just contacted me.\"Infuriated at the news of the measure, her fingers clapped at her keyboard as she typed a letter to Creighton.\"I have stood over her bed for hundreds of nights watching her suffering,\" she wrote. \"If you have not experienced this heartbreak, you have no right to judge.\"Dortha and Lesli made headlines when the Texas Supreme Court agreed parents could sue doctors for \"wrongful birth.\"After the Supreme Court ruling, her family received about $120,000 in a settlement reached with Theimer -- money that was placed in a special needs trust for Lesli. At the time, the family owed $21,472 in medical bills. Back then, Dortha made just $4,200 a year as a teacher.After the suit, she was forced to move from Wichita Falls to Dallas because doctors back home refused to treat her two children. Her marriage to Leslis father didnt survive the move.Dortha has left the money in the trust mostly untouched in recent years, preferring to pay Leslis out-of-pocket costs with her own money. Its a burden shes more than willing to take on. That way, there is money left for Leslis care long after Mom is gone.Dortha keeps a yellow scrapbook called \"The First Six Years.\" The first page announces Leslis birth, hailing the 6-pound, 10½-ounce girl. Next to it, a black-and-white photograph shows Lesli with her mouth open and both fists clenched.Memories burst from the albums pages. Leslis 7-year-old brother, Jake, beams on the couch, his little sister in his arms. On her 4th birthday, Lesli sits in front of a giant cake shaped like a teddy bear.The message below, like others in the scrapbook, is in Leslis voice, written as her mother imagined it: \"I have now learned to sit alone, and in four more months, I will crawl. My teachers worked on helping me sit for over three years.\"Turn the page. Lesli is sprawled out, crawling. \"I no longer have to just lie where someone places me.\"But there are sobering reminders, too.\"At one time, I took over 40 medications daily.\"\"If only you could hear me long enough to say, I love you. \"On the back page is a final note, which Dortha reads in a soft, hushed Texas twang.\"This has been the story of my first 6 years. I have brought a new kind of love and strength into the lives of many,\" she reads.\"I have fought hard and suffered to live. Very few days of my life are without pain, but still I smile.\"Dortha, right, and her husband have spent countless hours touching and stroking Lesli.Mom closes the book and uses tissue to dab her eyes.\"I did try for so long to think that things would be a lot better, and then you start accepting,\" she says. \"You have to learn to accept that some things are going to just be.\"Dortha accepted that the milestones would become few and far between. Lesli would never learn to stand on her own. She would never speak. She would never hear her moms words: \"I love you.\"Who gets to decide?Lesli sits in a wheelchair in her room, her head hunched over. She sports a crew cut. If her hair grows out much more than an inch, shell pull it out. One of her eyes was removed due to cataracts. Her other is so deteriorated, its hard to tell whether its even there.Her group home sits in a cul-de-sac in Cypress, Texas, about 25 miles northwest of Houston. The spacious three-bedroom brick home with wood siding blends in well with the four residential homes on the street. The only thing that distinguishes the house is the specialty van with wheelchair access in the driveway.Its a home she shares with five others, all of whom receive round-the-clock care.The letters L-E-S-L-I gaze down from the wall above her bed. Next to them rests a cowboy hat.Dortha rubs her daughters right hand. Dorthas husband of 32 years, Tom Biggs, runs his fingers back and forth across the back of her neck. Dortha decided he was a keeper when he didnt cut and run like most guys upon seeing the severity of Leslis disabilities.\"He has patted hands as many hours as I have,\" she says.Dortha never gave birth to another child. Shortly after Lesli was born, she was told that her baby was perfect. She had her tubes tied three days later. The following week, Dortha spotted cataracts in her daughters eyes, the start of the arduous journey theyre still traveling.Standing over her daughter, Dortha has a message for the senator who drafted the bill. \"Senator Creighton has not stood where I have stood or walked in my shoes. He has not,\" she says. \"He has not stood and watched a child suffer like this.\"She says its interesting that the current administration in Washington, as well as Texas lawmakers, wants to deregulate everything from the EPA to banks to businesses. \"But when it comes to the most intimate decisions an individual has to make, its lets put more regulations on that.\"Im the one who should have made the decision.\"Does she still wish her daughter had never been born?\"Yes,\" she says.Lesli has lived in this group home since 2000; she shares it with five others.Holding her daughters right hand, Dortha chokes up. Lesli places her mothers right hand on the back of her neck. Mom strokes her daughters head. Tom rubs Leslis left arm.Mom continues talking through her tears: \"Because I have had the joy of loving her, but Ive had the sorrow of watching her suffer. She has suffered so much of her life. If she could have come through the suffering and come through it and be able to enjoy her life more, I think it would have been a different issue.\"Mother and daughter now hold hands. Lesli moans. \"But, no, I could never have said I want her to experience this -- just to be born. Anyone who would say they thought that was the right thing to do has not stood and watched a child suffer like this.\"She understands that those words in her daughters presence might come across as cruel or twisted, but she reiterates that its for the love of her daughter and the freedom from her pain that she wishes shed had an abortion or allowed her body to abort naturally.\"I could never have made the choice to have terminated the pregnancy for me or the hardships that it would bring on me,\" she says. \"But I could have in a heartbeat for her -- knowing what she was going to go through.\"The wrong messageMore than a dozen specialty vans line up about 8:30 a.m. at a community center about 15 minutes from Leslis home. Its on the grounds of the faith-based nonprofit that runs Leslis home and several others in the surrounding area.Every weekday, about 70 residents from the various group homes are driven to the center for specialized treatment.Its the first day of spring, and the Texas heat is already suffocating, pushing 80 degrees.Lesli is helped from her van in her wheelchair and escorted into a cavernous building with polished floors. She comes here for therapy and worship.Once in class, Lesli takes up a seat in a beige recliner and relaxes. Class leader Catherine Konneh brings over bean bags and rubber balls so she can feel them. Lesli pushes them away.Konneh tries a variety of scents to arouse her olfactory senses. Lesli holds her nose over the smell of strawberry and takes in the aroma.Konnehs goal for Lesli is to someday wash her hands on her own. \"I keep (the residents) active,\" she says, \"so that whatever skills they have, they wont lose them.\"Next, everyone moves to the fellowship hall, where therapy dogs greet the crowd. Lesli seems more interested in the touch of the dog handlers than the dogs. She grabs the trainers hands and places them on the back of her neck. When a fluffy white dog named Lammie licks her face, she backs up her wheelchair.But a black pooch named Omri makes a breakthrough. Omri places one paw on her leg, and she pets him with the help of the handler.Lesli pushed away bean bags and rubber balls but welcomed the chance to pet Omri with his handlers help.By early afternoon, Lesli, Dortha and Tom meet with staff for her annual review, going over her care for the upcoming year. The severity of her disabilities are rattled off: blind, deaf, cerebral palsy, allergies, seizure disorder, autism.Even the most minute details are covered. All tags on her shirts must be cut off because they annoy her. Her wheelchair footrest must be down at all times to keep her from falling. Pay attention to her picking at her underwear. She prefers hot lunches, preferably noodles with no MSG.Lesli moans through much of the session and plays with Konnehs hands while Mom listens.Her care for the upcoming year will cost about $200,000. Medicare and Medicaid will cover most of it.More than two hours away in Austin, state senators take up the wrongful birth bill.Dressed in a navy suit and light blue tie, Creighton stands on the floor and tells his colleagues that Senate Bill 25 prohibits \"patients from suing their physician for lifelong payments, claiming that they would not have had their baby had they known different information. It removes the wrongful birth cause of action.\"He says doctors currently are \"overcautiously suggesting termination in order to protect themselves.\"Democratic Sen. Jose Rodriguez of El Paso pushes back, saying the current law exists to protect women like Dortha and remains relevant even today. He said the Texas Supreme Court found that the doctor \"had failed to carry out his obligation of fully informing the patient.\"\"Its about ultimately the womans right to receive accurate information from her doctor, so she can make an informed choice,\" Rodriguez says.The bill sails through. It must now go before the House for final approval.Creighton soaks in the moment not too long after the vote. He tells CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that it is time for the \"archaic 40-year-old cause of action\" to go away.\"It just sends the wrong message,\" he says. \"It sends a message that the best physicians in America should not practice in Texas because ... you have to consider that you could be held liable just for doing your job correctly.\"Told thats not true -- and certainly not what happened in Dorthas case -- Creighton insists that hes correct because lawyers are clever and \"you can be sued for anything.\"Lesli touches the plants as she is wheeled outside. On weekdays, she attends therapy at a nearby community center.Asked why he never contacted Dortha, he offers several answers. First, he says its because of privacy concerns -- even though he brought her case into the fight. Then, he says he cant contact everyone from past cases about new legislation. He says he plans to respond to her letter but hasnt had time. He says he hopes to meet her one day.He says he was especially moved by her \"exceptional\" letter. \"Im very, very proud of her, almost to a heroic standpoint, just what it takes to raise a child and the challenges in disabilities.\"Legal experts say wrongful birth suits are rarely filed and certainly dont scare doctors from opening up practice in Texas. One former director of the Texas Medical Board told a Senate panel that her agency had investigated only five wrongful birth cases since 1975, according to Courthouse News Service.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.And while Creighton maintains that an expectant mother who is given a wrong diagnosis during pregnancy would still have other means to pursue a lawsuit, legal scholars say that is not true.If you take away the wrongful birth cause of action, \"there is no other action,\" said George Annas, director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at Boston University.\"What this guy doesnt like is making a decision to terminate a pregnancy,\" Annas said. \"He doesnt want you to do that.\"That motivation was on display just before Creighton answered CNNs questions. A lawmaker stopped by and slapped him on the back: \"Congratulations, youre the only senator whos gotten a pro-life bill through this session.\"The irony, Dortha says, is that the first thing to go when GOP-led legislatures begin slashing budgets is money for programs serving the special-needs and mentally ill communities. Put more precisely, she says, they care only when a child is in the womb, not after.\"They dont love my daughter. They dont know my daughter,\" she says.If they cared, she says, they would have contacted her. They would have toured her daughters group home. They would have held Leslis hand.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/04/04/health/texas-wrongful-birth-dortha-lesli/index.html"}, {"title": "Stopping the opioid crisis in the womb", "data_published": "2017-05-05T07:20:37Z", "content": "Knoxville, Tennessee (CNN) The sound of a heartbeat pulsates through the air, and a grainy image of a baby flashes on screen. Jessica Hill smiles from her chair in the ultrasound room.Gathered around are her doctor, nurse and best friend.They are all eager, anxious, excited -- and worried about the health of the baby. In that way, this ultrasound is like most.But whats happening in this room is anything but routine: Jessica, 28, is hooked on opioids and detoxing during pregnancy. Dr. Craig Towers is the pioneering -- and controversial -- obstetrician shattering the common medical belief that this approach could lead to the death of the fetus.Moments earlier, Jessicas baby underwent a stress test to see how she was progressing, a way to make sure the stress of detoxing is not harming the child. \"She didnt like it at all,\" says Jessica, who is in her 35th week of pregnancy.Tell us your story Tell us your story of how you or a loved one is working through an addiction to opioids or other painkilling drugs, from successes to struggles. Text/WhatsApp us at +1-347-322-0415\"It means that shes paying attention to whats going on,\" says Towers, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies at the University of Tennessee Medical Center.Jessica admits to making many mistakes, but here, she is making what she says is the best choice of her life: getting clean for her baby. She also has an 8-year-old son who has been raised by her mom. She hopes detoxing will further heal their relationship.A tattoo above her heart reads \"From pain comes strength.\"She wishes she could lean over her belly, put her lips by her daughters head and whisper to her about life lessons. \"Im working on building our relationship and trying so hard. I mainly want her to know that I wont make those choices any more.\"Jessica marvels at the screen. \"Is that her little face?\"\"Yeah, thats a cheek,\" Towers says.\"Shes got chubby cheeks,\" Jessica replies.Jessica Hill, 28, was hooked on opioids and wanted to get clean, but she was told that detoxing would kill her fetus.When Jessica first came to Towers four months ago, she was taking a standard opioid-based maintenance medication, called Subutex, meant to keep her from getting her fix from the street. She had been told at a drug maintenance clinic that detoxing would kill her fetus.When she went to a doctor who she hoped could deliver her child, Jessica was humiliated. She had informed the doctor she was taking Subutex to tamp down her urge for painkillers. The doctor, she says, told her they dont \"take irresponsible patients.\"\"I was just so upset, because they just shunned us away,\" she says.The maintenance clinic then referred her to the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Jessica first visited a doctor at the hospitals prenatal clinic in December and was introduced to Emily Katz, the substance abuse coordinator in Towers office. Katz saw a young woman who needed help -- but, more important, wanted help.\"We snatched her up,\" she says. \"There was just a spark in her. When I told Jessica, I think we can help you, tears just streamed down her face.\"Its now mid-March. Towers has weaned Jessica off the medication slowly, with Jessica making the hour-long trip from her home in Morristown to his office every two weeks, almost always accompanied by her best friend, Stephanie Moore. Today, Stephanie chimes in with cheerful jokes about the babys stubbornness, similar to her mothers.In between visits, Jessica texts and phones Katz, who was motivated to help others after her brother died of an overdose. The two have become so close over the months that both say theyre like twins separated at birth. Jessica has nicknamed Katz \"Nurse Barbie\" for her attractiveness and her straight blonde hair.On this day, Katz quietly observes during the ultrasound, making her show of support by just being there.Jessica went completely off the opioids over the past week, a critical juncture during any detoxification. She suffered through diarrhea and other ailments. Only once did she give into her urge, taking one Subutex pill. \"It sucks,\" she says.In those down moments, Stephanie and Katz remind her why shes going through this: that the struggle is worth the pain.But even with all that Jessica has endured, theres no guarantee her baby will be free of the violent tremors and excruciating pain that marks those born to addicted mothers. About one in five women who detox in Towers program still sees her baby suffer withdrawal after birth, depending on how early in pregnancy the mothers were able to become drug-free and how their bodies metabolize the opioids still in their systems.Dr. Craig Towers has helped more than 500 women detox during pregnancy: \"Its the right thing to do.\"Towers assures Jessica that her baby will be safe if she continues to not use. With the due date a month away, he says he wants to begin seeing her twice a week to make sure she stays on track.Her pregnancy was not planned, and Jessica worries that child services could take her daughter away because of her history of drug abuse.\"The only way they would take her from you is if you were using something off the street or if theres something in your drug screen that wasnt prescribed to you,\" Towers says. \"Thats why I just want to see you a lot, make sure youre doing OK, and if theres any issues, we prevent a relapse.\"The next few weeks will prove critical. Jessica will lean on this supportive cast: the doctor, her best friend and \"Nurse Barbie.\"Towers knows all too well whats at stake. Three days earlier, an expectant woman who he hoped would enroll in his program was found dead of an overdose, the first such death this year in Knox County.Concerns over relapse riskEvery 25 minutes in America, a baby is born in withdrawal from opioids . They shake violently, vomit constantly and scream incessantly. Upon arrival in this world, one of the first things the newborns are given is an opioid to lessen the intensity of their shakes.Delivery rooms have become overwhelmed, especially along the Appalachia corridor stretching from Ohio and West Virginia into Kentucky and down to this northeast corner of Tennessee. The average hospital stay for a baby suffering withdrawal lasts about 17 days, costing more than $66,000 per child, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Tennessee alone experienced a 15-fold increase in babies going through withdrawal from 2002 to 2012. And the numbers have continued to rise.How to treat these babies has become a matter of urgency among doctors, clinicians, researchers and social workers. Are we failing these newborns? What are we not doing that we should? Can more be done on the front end to prevent the shaking and vomiting?The University of Tennessee Medical Center sits amid the heart of Americas opioid epidemic.Almost everyone agrees that the nation must tackle this issue with a comprehensive approach. But the opinions on what to do vary. Long-standing guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on detoxification during pregnancy has been this: \"Withdrawal from opioid use during pregnancy is associated with poor neonatal outcomes, including early preterm births or fetal demise, and with higher relapse rates among women.\"At a summit on prescription drug and heroin abuse in Atlanta in April, participants from across the country discussed the increasing number of babies going through withdrawal and how to best care for them and their mothers. Experts stressed the need for better treatment programs for pregnant women, especially in rural America.Detoxification during pregnancy wasnt considered a viable policy approach at the conference. Some experts said it would be careless -- even reckless. Even if detoxing were medically safe, they said, the risk of relapse was too great, putting newborns in danger as soon as they went home.Dr. Stephen Patrick of Vanderbilt University said that he likes Towers and admires his work but that there are too many questions.\"My biggest worry about detoxing in pregnancy are rates of relapse,\" says Patrick, assistant professor of pediatrics and health policy at Vanderbilt and an attending neonatologist.Recent studies have found that women who use opioids have a 40% to 70% rate of relapse, Patrick said.\"I would never say that detoxification may not be the right thing for an individual woman, in the right setting with the right supports,\" Patrick added. \"Its just that overall, I find it worrisome because of relapse rates.\"One couldnt help but wonder: Why would a doctor stake his career on something so risky?We can winTowers, 62, never expected to be a trailblazer in this field. Hed followed the protocol for nearly four decades: Never detox an expectant mother because of the possibility of \"fetal demise,\" the clinical term for a stillbirth.But about the time he arrived at the University of Tennessee Medical Center seven years ago, the opioid epidemic hit. Women kept asking why they couldnt detox during pregnancy.Jessica says that getting clean for her baby is one of the best decisions shes ever made. \"I hope our relationship always stays strong.\"He looked into the research, expecting to confirm everything hed followed for years. \"To my surprise,\" he says, \"I found it came from two case reports.\"Those two cases in the 1970s set the course for doctors to advise against detoxification. Towers dug further and found that five other, mostly overlooked studies involving about 300 women had been done over a 23-year period beginning in the 1990s. Each indicated that detoxification didnt pose a risk to the fetus.He embarked on his own study and found detox to be safe. \"Over the last six years, Ive detoxed more than 500 women without a loss,\" he says. \"There really is no data in the literature to support that detoxification will kill the baby. Like I said, it came from a propagation of two single case reports in the literature in the 1970s.\"Detoxification, he admits, is not for every woman. His patients have horrific back stories that too often include rape, physical abuse and generational addiction. \"Each case is complicated,\" he says. \"We never coerce anybody or shame them into detox. The patient has to be interested in this. Otherwise, theyre not going to succeed.\"Like others, Towers worries about relapse. When he started his detoxification program, the rate of relapse among the participating mothers was more than 70%, compared with 40% and 60% for all people in addiction treatment nationwide.Four years ago, he hired Katz so women could stay in constant contact with his office throughout their pregnancies and for eight weeks after they leave the hospital. He hopes to increase that supervision time to six months to a year. But already, he says, the rate of relapse since adding the behavioral health component has dropped to around 17%.Not a single woman has fatally overdosed after going through his program. \"Knock on wood,\" he says.He gives speeches across the country to spread the news of his research, and he meets with insurance companies in hopes they will pay for it. To deny women who want to get clean the opportunity to do so is wrong, he says, especially as they enter the crucial role of becoming a mother.\"This is a treatable disorder, and we can win,\" he says. \"Hopefully, one of these days, well change the protocol for the country. We just have to continue plugging away.\"And shouldnt the medical community try to stop generational addiction in the womb, he wonders, rather than allowing the cycle to continue?Towers never intended to be a trailblazer, but he says nothing is better than when a patient tells him, \"You saved my life.\"CNN asked to follow one of Towers patients during the detoxification process. Jessica agreed to share her story, but only in the confines of his office. She didnt want to draw attention in her small town and wanted to protect her son from cameras.\"The main thing I want people to know is to take my testimony of where I was to where I am now,\" she says. \"And maybe if it can help one person make a better decision, then it would be worth it.\"She calls Towers office a \"godsend\" for getting her on the road to sobriety, something she says she could never do on her own. When she first came to his office, she was taking 8 milligrams a day of Subutex. Some days, she took twice that amount.Shed been told that her baby would die if she tried to detox, so she was following the maintenance therapy program prescribed to her by the previous clinic. She wept when Towers told her that if she stayed on that level of Subutex, her baby might suffer withdrawal in the weeks following birth.\"I told him I wanted to be off of it, but I just didnt know how to be off of it,\" she says. \"Thats what started the whole thing of him helping me.\"Jessica works in an assisted-living community. She likes helping the elderly, speaking with them and hearing their life stories. Shes pushed through days of feeling horrible and the terrible loneliness brought on by detoxification.\"Its always that wage of war in your mind -- that you feel so crappy. Its so hard to try and do the right thing,\" she says. \"You have those thoughts of, why have I done this? \"Her friend Stephanie has talked her off the ledge in moments of desperation. \"When I want to make a stupid decision,\" Jessica says, \"she yells at me.\"\"I have a really good support system, but I had to choose to walk away from all the negative people in my life.\"Jessica has lost more than 10 friends to overdoses in recent years -- a stark reminder of the need to stay sober.Two great childhoods divergedJessica and Stephanie met at church 21 years ago. Jessica was 8; Stephanie was 9. Stephanie immediately stole Jessicas Bible, starting their relationship off with a tussle.But soon, a friendship blossomed. They sang in a choir in their hometown of Morristown and took up leadership positions in church. Through youth group, they went on vacations to places like Destin, Florida, and Dollywood.Jessicas best friend, Stephanie Moore, has accompanied her to nearly every appointment.Stephanie, the petite one, often ended up underneath her sleeping friend in the backseat on road trips. \"She was always like that,\" Stephanie says, holding up photographic proof.Morristown is a picturesque American landscape in the northeastern corner of Tennessee, where the tops of mountains dance with the clouds and where US and Tennessee flags fly on telephone poles along Main Street.Places like the Timeless Elegance Tea Room occupy space near the Jersey Girl Diner downtown. Steps away, the Village Gunsmith Gun Store anchors a corner. A sign posted along a country road advertises \"Angus bull for sale.\"It was an enjoyable youth. \"We did everything together,\" Stephanie says.Adds Jessica, \"We really had great childhoods.\"But their lives took disparate paths. When Jessica was 14, her father died, sending her into a spiral. She began hanging out with 30-year-old meth users. Without even realizing it, she had begun an addiction.Stephanie remembers visiting Jessicas home, watching her zoom around the house with a vacuum cleaner, sweating up a storm, zonked out of her mind. Stephanie opened one of Jessicas makeup kits and found a meth pipe.\"Thats when I realized that were probably not on the same path,\" Stephanie recalls.They drifted apart in high school. Jessica became unrecognizable. She was manipulative, cunning, deceitful. She pushed away everyone who loved her.Her mom had always been her rock. But Jessica wrecked that relationship. She had an unplanned pregnancy when she was 20. Her mom has essentially raised the boy. By 22, Jessicas relationship with her mother \"was gone.\"\"She was so scared that she was going to get that phone call,\" Jessica says, crying.Her meth addiction had only grown. Shed take anything she could get her hands on.Jessica and Stephanie have been friends for 21 years. They hope drugs will never get in the way of their friendship again.Three years ago, she underwent back surgery and got hooked on opioids at warp speed. Shed go through a months worth of prescription pills in a week and scramble to feed her habit for the rest of the month. She couldnt hold down a job.\"I couldnt do anything but be strung out, pretty much,\" she says. \"It just grabs a hold of you, and you lose sight of reality -- and before you know it, its just too late.\"The opioids provided a high like shed never felt. Like many who get hooked on painkillers, she eventually graduated to heroin, overdosing twice.\"I just wasnt me. You could look at me and see I wasnt there,\" she says. \"They took my life away. They took my soul away.\"She ended up homeless and, at one point, was raped. \"It was just horrible,\" she weeps.Jessica has worked to repair her relationship with her mother -- something \"that Ive missed since I was 16 years old.\" Her mother is supportive of the pregnancy and says shes excited for the birth of her granddaughter. \"Shes my No. 1,\" says Jessica.Jessica has restored her relationship with her son. She wears a necklace he gave her; on it hangs an infinity sign and the word \"Mom.\"\"I put him through so much, so much. My mom pretty much had to raise him because I couldnt step up.\"She hopes that will never be the case with her daughter.At one of her sons football practices last summer, she ran into Stephanie. They realized just how much they missed each other. Their old friendship was rekindled.Jessica was in Stephanies garden when she learned that she was pregnant. Jessica cried, thinking there was no way she could care for the child. Stephanie, who has a son about the same age as Jessicas, reassured her that the child would be her greatest blessing.Stephanie accompanied Jessica to the first ultrasound. When the two heard the heartbeat, they knew they couldnt abandon the pregnancy. She and Stephanie would make the journey together. \"I see this baby as mine, too,\" says Stephanie.Jessica says her addiction wrecked her closest relationships. Shes worked to repair her friendship with her mother. \"For so long, I didnt have her, so I felt like I didnt have anyone.\"Stephanie says Towers work has been transformative: \"I have my best friend back, and I would just like to keep her.\"The two got tattoos on their feet not long after Jessica began her journey to get clean. Their choices reveal the yin and yang of their friendship.\"You keep me safe,\" says Stephanies tattoo.And Jessicas: \"You keep me wild.\"You got to want it, tooJessica sits down in a small office with Katz to have a heart-to-heart talk.The nurse stays in near-constant contact with 80 women in the high-risk unit. They text, email and talk by cell phone at all hours.\"Were not going to judge them for their past,\" she says.Katz tells each woman about her brother, who died in 2009 from an overdose of methadone and other drugs. He left behind an 18-month-old boy. The pain of that memory still brings tears eight years later. She promised her young nephew that something good would come from his fathers death.Emily Katz has proved to be the key at keeping women on track during detoxification. Rates of relapse have plummeted since shes joined Towers office.When she heard that Towers needed help, she knew she had a new purpose in life.\"I treat each one of these girls like theyre my sister, like theyre my best friend, like theyre my daughter,\" she says, \"because we have a common denominator.\"Every day, this is my passion that I get to sit before these girls. I share my testimony, and they get to share theirs. That relationship builds trust more than just nurse to patient. Its more than that.\"Jessica confides that she took 2 milligrams of Subutex the day before. \"I wish I wouldnt have even broke down yesterday, but I just couldnt do it,\" she says.Katz looks her in the eyes. \"I know, its hard,\" she says.Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Prescription and illegal opioids are commonly abused because they are so addictive.Opioid medications bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brains reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria.As the brain becomes used to the feelings, it often takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to dependence and, later, addiction. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Oxymorphone hydrochloride – Oxymorphone hydrochloride, under the name Opana ER, was at the center of an HIV outbreak in Indiana in 2015. Some addicts began injecting and shared needles increased the spread of HIV.In June, the Food and Drug Administration requested that Opana ER manufacturer Endo Pharmaceuticals pull the drug from the market. It was the first time the agency has asked that a opioid pain medication be pulled \"due to the public health consequences of abuse.\" Endo announced in July that it would pull the drug. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Codeine – Codeine is one of the weakest opioids, often given when painkillers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen fail to work. Because it decreases activity in the part of the brain that controls coughing, its frequently mixed with other liquids to develop cough syrups for colds and flu. It has frequently been used for pain relief after removal of tonsils and adenoids in children.After an investigation, the FDA restricted the use of codeine and tramadol in children under 12 and recommend against their use in children between 12 and 18 years of age. Additionally, the FDA has warned breastfeeding mothers not to take these medications due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

According to the CDC , deaths from overdoses of prescription drugs and heroin continue to be the leading cause of unintentional death for Americans, rising 14% from 2013 to 2014. Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Fentanyl – Fentanyl citrate, pictured here, is a Class II controlled substance and one of the most powerful opioids on the market. Its often administered via injection or transdermal patch, or in lozenge form for pain after surgery, for difficult-to-manage chronic pain and for people who have developed a tolerance to other opioids.The type of fentanyl usually associated with overdoses is bought on the street in powder or pill form and is often mixed with heroin in a clandestine lab to increase the high it produces. Street names include Apache, China girl, goodfella, jackpot, murder 8, TNT and Tango and Cash. Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Hydrocodone – These pills are a more powerful form of codeine, called hydrocodone, and are often mixed with acetaminophen. Hydrocodone is the most frequently prescribed opioid painkiller, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and the most abused. An overdose of hydrocodone can cause \"cold and clammy skin, severely constricted pupils, and slow breathing that can lead to a loss of consciousness and death.\" Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Oxycodone – Oxycodone is a powerful narcotic pain reliever prescribed for moderate to high pain relief. Its often given in an extended-release formula for patients who will need to be on pain medications for long periods of time.Patients are warned not to break, chew, crush or dissolve extended-release tablets because the rush of oxycodone into the system could cause serious health problems, including overdose and death.Though highly addictive, oxycodone is not thought to be as frequently abused as hydrocodone. OxyContin, Percocet, Percodan and Tylox are some trade-name oxycodone products. Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Morphine – Morphine is another powerful opioid often administered via syringe for severe pain. It can come in pill form, usually as extended-release tablets and capsules, and is prescribed only to relieve difficult, chronic pain that cannot be controlled by the use of other pain medications.As with most opioids, mixing medications, drinking alcohol or taking other meds that contain alcohol, or using street drugs while taking morphine, increases the risk of breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening side effects. Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Meperidine – Meperidine is another narcotic analgesic, similar to morphine. Its often used to help put people to sleep before an operation and to provide pain relief after childbirth.The most common brand name is Demerol, which comes in both tablet and liquid forms. It is usually taken with or without food every three or four hours as needed for pain.As with all opioids, meperidine can cause drowsiness, so never drive a car or operate machinery after taking it until you know how you will react.

Its most commonly known by the brand names Dilaudid, pictured here, and Exalgo.Liquid hydromorphone holds the dubious honor of being frequently mistaken for morphine in hospital \"wrong drug\" medication errors because of the similarity of the names and appearances. Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Methadone – Though methadone is used to relieve severe chronic pain, its most commonly known for preventing withdrawal symptoms in patients who were addicted to opioid drugs, as a part of their recovery process.Methadone has many of the same side effects as other opioids, including weakness, headache, nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, sweating, difficulty urinating, mood changes and vision problems, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Opioids: Addictive painkillers Buprenorphine – Buprenorphine is a opioid used as an alternative to methadone to help addicts recovering from heroin use. Buprenorphine is different from other opioids because its a \"partial opioid agonist,\" which means that when taken in proper prescribed doses, it should produce less euphoria and physical dependence, and therefore a lower potential for misuse. Its also supposed to have a relatively mild withdrawal profile.However, if abused by crushing and snorting or injecting, it can suppress breathing and cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.Subutex, the brand name for buprenorphine, is taken as a tablet placed under the tongue and allowed to dissolve.The brand Suboxone is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Antagonists block the opiate receptors in the brain, keeping the narcotic from creating the high abusers crave.Hide Caption 12 of 12Jessicas boyfriend has been the gatekeeper of her Subutex pills. Katz suggests that the medication be given to Stephanie so she can intervene when Jessica begins to slide and ask her friend, \"Whats going on?\"\"That also just gives you a little bit more support -- to make sure that person understands what youre going through, that youre trying to taper and that youre trying not to use,\" Katz says.During those low points, she says, write in a journal about why youre doing this. Keep your daughter in your thoughts at all times.\"Youre doing so great. I mean, were so proud of you. We really are,\" Katz says. \"I could want this all day long for you, girl, but you got to want it, too.\"In a sign of how much she wants to be free from the grips of addiction, Jessica says she hopes that non-opioid painkillers will be used for her C-section. Shed prefer the pain over relapse.Preparing for birthExcitement overflows in the labor and delivery room. Its Thursday, April 20. The day has finally come. Accompanying Jessica are her mother, Kathy Hill; Jessicas 31-year-old boyfriend, Jason Smith; and Stephanie.Jessica has been fully detoxed for 17 days.Jessica is surrounded by friends, family and hospital staff shortly before her C-section on April 20.Stephanie braids Jessicas hair to pass the time. They tell the nurse theyve been friends for more than 20 years, with major ups and downs. \"Its good now,\" Jessica says.She hoped to avoid a cesarean section, but in the end, a vaginal birth was not an option. The C-section has been planned for shortly after noon. Jessica cant contain her giddiness. \"Ive been picturing what she might look like,\" she says.\"Im nervous. Im just ready to see her,\" Jessica says. \"Its been hard, but its probably one of the best things Ive done. For sure.\"Theres a chattiness about the room. Jessica debates her mom: What football team should her son play on?Theres paperwork galore to be signed, too.Katz pops into the room. Jessica greets her with a joke: \"Wheres Dr. Towers at? I was about to yell at him if he didnt let you come.\"The two laugh. The night before, they werent laughing. Consumed by an overwhelming sense of impending motherhood, Jessica freaked out. She called Katz from a different phone than usual. Katz was at dinner and let it ring because she didnt recognize the number. Immediately, a text pinged Katzs phone: \"This is Jessica. Call me.\"Knowing that a fragile state can lead to relapse, Katz stopped what she was doing. \"I cant do this,\" Jessica told her. \"Im not ready.\"Katz spoke gently and talked her down. She told Jessica that she was ready and that she could do this. It was mostly a fear of the unknown -- a vulnerable expectant mother needing someone to speak with in the moment.Says Katz: \"I told her, Youre not going to back out now. \"A stream of nurses and medical professionals comes and goes in Jessicas room. Shed hoped that both Stephanie and her boyfriend could both be in the operating room for the delivery. But Towers breaks the bad news: She must choose only one. \"I tried, but theres not enough space,\" he tells her. \"You can be mad at me.\"He encourages her to pick the most supportive person. Smiling, Jessica says, \"If they fight about it too much, then my mom is going.\"Jessica picks her boyfriend, Jason Smith, to be in the delivery room, but she lectures him not to pass out during the birth.She ultimately chooses her boyfriend, saying she cant deny him the right to see the moment his daughter is born. Soon, Dad-to-be is a ball of nerves. He has to leave the room when her IV is inserted; hows he going to handle when her belly is sliced open?\"You better not pass out,\" Jessica warns.The nurse tells him a drape will block the view. \"Just sit there and look at her, not to the left or right,\" she advises.He nods, climbs into Jessicas bed and kisses her. Mom and Stephanie crowd around, and a final selfie is snapped.At 12:44 p.m., Jessica learns that its time.\"Ill see you in a minute,\" Towers says. \"Youre going to do good.\"Her mom says, \"You got this, honey.\"\"Good luck,\" adds Stephanie.Jessica gets wheeled down the hall to the operating room. On a whiteboard is a message stating todays goal: \"Healthy mom & baby!\"Welcome, Jayda JewelTowers paces outside the operating room, dressed in blue scrubs and a surgical cap. He removes his wedding band and ties it around the drawstring on his pants. He tapes his surgical mask to his face so his glasses wont fog up.Inside, Jessica has been given a spinal tap to numb the pain. Surgical drapes cover Jessicas body, and the room is abuzz with organized chaos.Nurse Kirby Ginn wheels Jessica toward the operating room.Katz pauses outside the room. She prays for God to be with Towers and to give Jessica the strength to get through the surgery and for the child to be born healthy. Then she heads into the room.\"Youre doing great, Jessica,\" says Dr. Kim Fortner, a member of the medical team. \"Were all right here. Its almost over, OK?\"A look of excruciating pain spreads across Jessicas face.\"Think about her sweet baby cheeks, Jessica,\" says nurse Kirby Ginn.Moments later, at 1:32 p.m., a beautiful baby girl with chubby cheeks and a patch of brown hair emerges. Jayda Jewel Hill lets out two loud screams.Towers and his team quickly clean her up and swaddle her in a blanket adorned with teddy bears. She weighs in at 6 pounds and stretches 17 inches.\"Are you ready to see her?\" the nurse asks.\"Yes, maam,\" Jessica replies.Her daughter is placed across her chest. Jessica cradles her with both hands, her right hand patting her back.\"Aww,\" Jessica says.\"She looks great,\" Towers says.The baby coughs a few times, worrying Jessica.\"Why is she coughing like that?\" she says.Jayda Jewel Hill was born at 1:32 p.m. April 20. She was born with fluid in her lungs, requiring her to be monitored for much of the evening in the neonatal intensive care unit.Caught up in the moment, the father seems to miss the question, asking a nurse to take a photo of him with his daughter.He clutches the swaddled newborn and leans in next to Jessicas face -- the birthing room in the era of social media. \"Hi, little gorgeous. Hi there, beautiful. Look, theres your momma,\" the gleeful father says.The baby coughs a few more times. \"Is she OK?\" Jessica asks.Towers explains that the baby sucked in amniotic fluid during surgery. The fluid will be removed from her lungs; its nothing to be worried about, he assures her.Katz leans in and holds Jessicas right hand. She tells her to stay strong, that her daughter is healthy. She tells her the baby is going to be taken away to be observed in the neonatal intensive care unit.Just before stitching Jessica up, Towers uses a non-opioid drug similar to novocaine to dull the pain for 24 hours. Jessica also receives Tylenol IV and an anti-inflammatory drug, Toradol.\"Shes hoping to not need any pain pills,\" he says. \"It is major surgery. Your abdomen is open, so it hurts.\"Anything to avoid relapse.Bucking the trendLess than 24 hours after the birth, more than 150 doctors, nurse practitioners and other health officials from across East Tennessee gather in an auditorium at the UT medical center.On stage, Towers steps through a slideshow presentation of opioid use disorder in pregnancy. He reels off stats from the CDC: From 2000 to 2015, more than half a million people died from drug overdoses, including 183,000 people from prescription opioids. \"Unfortunately, were only getting worse,\" he says.In Tennessee, he notes, three people die from overdoses every day. He talks about his findings, of the women whove detoxed in his program. \"Were bucking the trend,\" Towers says.As is tradition, the newborns footprints were stamped shortly after birth. Jayda Jewel weighed in at 6 pounds and stretched 17 inches.\"Im passionate because I just believe its the right way to do medicine,\" he says. \"We dont always succeed. I dont know anyone who succeeds all the time when dealing with addiction. But my passion comes from the ones that weve delivered that dont have (withdrawal) and the look in the mothers eye when they say, You saved my life.\"I dont think you can get any better response from a patient.\"Shortly after the speech, he takes an elevator to the third floor and visits Jessica and her baby. Jessica sports a pink T-shirt that says \"Dont want to be here.\"\"We want to be home,\" she says.Jayda Jewel, nicknamed JJ, looks like the perfect child, with big eyes, content in her mothers arms. She shows no signs of withdrawal, although symptoms can take a couple of days to appear.Jessica hugs the doctor. \"I couldnt have done this without you and Emily,\" she says.Outside Towers presence, Stephanie repeats that sentiment, telling Jessica, \"Youre so lucky you got him.\"\"If it werent for this baby, you might not have got off Subutex ever.\"Over the next several days, Jayda Jewel exhibits no signs of withdrawal, but Jessicas pain intensifies. Shes given three Vicodin pills, an opioid painkiller. The typical C-section patient gets 10, Towers says.Jessica had hoped to be given an opioid blocker called Vivitrol, which can resist the urge to use for up to a month. But to get it, her system must be clear of opioids for seven days. Towers expects to be able to give her the medicine in her followup appointment. \"She felt bad about that,\" he says.The door to Jessicas recovery room celebrates the life of her new daughter. Jayda Jewel, nicknamed JJ, did not suffer withdrawal.But still, she succeeded. Her baby was born healthy.Four days after the birth, Jessica straps Jayda Jewel in a car seat in her hospital room and then climbs into a wheelchair to be escorted out of the facility. Mom and daughter head down an elevator and out the front door.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Towers and Katz meet them at their car. Jessica places her baby inside and turns toward them.\"We made it,\" Jessica says, wrapping her arms around her \"Nurse Barbie.\" \"I love you.\"\"I love you, too,\" Katz responds.Then Jessica hugs Towers again.The car soon disappears around the corner, onto the highway and off to their hometown.

Roping competitions and pie socials help neighbors in crisis, and people make extra cash selling truckloads of dead coyotes to fur traders.Life in Grant County, population 641 , could not be more different than the gilded Big Apple existence long enjoyed by President Donald Trump. Still, it ranked among the top counties in the country supporting him in November; he got more than 93% of the votes here. And yet Grant holds another distinction: Its the county with the highest percentage of Obamacare enrollees in the nation.One in three residents, or 33% of the under-65 population, bought insurance on Obamacare exchanges, official data from a year ago show. The national average is just 5%, which raises the question: In a place so tied to the Affordable Care Act, why would people back the man who vowed to repeal it? Wouldnt that seem a vote against the communitys own interests?\"People may think were slow,\" explains one man, \"but were not stupid.\"In their world, one they feel is overlooked by those in big cities or on the coasts, their actions make perfect sense. You cant possibly understand, they say, unless youve lived here. I set out to try.Breaking the newsJust mention politics to a group of men unwinding over gas station coffee and the insults come fast and fierce, political correctness be damned.\"The black bomb\" is how one rancher describes Trumps predecessor. \"This guy came out of the sewers of Chicago. How could he be good?\"The ranchers not about to give his name to someone with the \"Clinton News Network\" -- what he calls CNN -- but he and his friends are happy to rail against the former administration. Obamacare is right up there on the list of things gone wrong, they say.The hands they extend for shakes are rough and callused, symbols of how hard people here work. They are self-sufficient and dont like being told what to do any more than they like taking handouts. They take care of themselves, and each other, and dont need government stepping in to muck things up.That their county leads the nation in Obamacare enrollees is news to everyone I meet.\"If theyre on it, theyre not saying,\" one man theorizes. People are on it only because the government \"put a gun to peoples heads,\" offers another. And just because theyre on it, they warn, doesnt mean they like it.No other choiceWalking through Hyannis, the county seat, I hear stories of skyrocketing premiums, deductibles that cant be met and brewing resentment. If people dont want to pay the penalty for not having insurance, which is taken out of the tax refunds they rely on, theyre trapped.What they tell me might give pause to Obamacare experts, who say the Affordable Care Act is complicated, is hard to navigate and often leaves people misinformed about costs and choices. But these are the experiences and perceptions of how the law has played out in Grant County.Why some Nebraskans hate Obamacare Less choice. Higher premiums. Ideological opposition. These are some of the reasons so many rural Nebraskans may not be happy with their insurance under Obamacare. But theres also evidence the Affordable Care Act has helped rural communities like Grant County -- gains that could be erased with a repeal. READ MORESome have appreciated newfound coverage: With it, they were able to take care of longstanding problems, like the woman with a prolapsing uterus who could finally have a hysterectomy. But most people I meet complain that theyre on Obamacare only because they have no other choice.Unless they work for the school, the county, the railroad or the electric company -- and the vast majority of people in cattle country dont -- these arent Americans fortunate to be covered by an employers insurance plan.Some might have been so lucky in the past, but that luck ran out when the Affordable Care Act came in, they say.Ginger Fouse curates the Grant County museum in the county courthouse. Shes rushing to make a doctors appointment in Alliance, 60 miles away and home to the closest hospital. Before she goes, she makes her feelings about Obamacare clear: \"Nothing but horseshit.\"Fouses husband is a ranch hand, and they used to get coverage through the ranch. But once Obamacare hit the scene, she says, the rancher believed everyone could take care of themselves. Only problem is, Fouse says, she and her husband can no longer afford the premiums. So theyre now covered by nothing.\"Were not going to quit eating to pay insurance,\" she says before heading out the door.Ellen White, a museum volunteer, steps in to introduce me to the area shes always called home.She shows off aged photographs: the old town hall where they used to dance, images from the 1949 blizzard that wiped out cattle and snapshots from the first old-timer rodeo.Ellen White, 69, volunteers at the county museum and speaks proudly of the history and work ethic that shaped her and others. \"Weve gotten along in this world without anyone telling us what to do,\" she says.A mans barbed-wire collection is on display, as is memorabilia from the deceased military doctor who delivered White and countless other locals.The highlight, though, is a collection of keepsakes from the late Chuck Hayward, who took his horses to Hollywood and worked as John Waynes stuntman. Included are action shots, the saddle Hayward used while filming in Afghanistan and wooden stirrups from a shoot in Chile. Theres also a saddle said to have been used by Wayne himself during the filming of \"True Grit.\"White, 69, describes a time she wishes younger generations would appreciate. She grew up on a ranch south of Ashby, an unincorporated community just west of Hyannis. She, like so many others, rode a horse to her country school.She had three older brothers, and if they told her she couldnt do something, she proved she could. She was able to drive a team of horses by age 5 and helped milk 12 to 15 cows every morning and night.Life was tough, but it made people who they are. They worked for everything they had.Sometimes she watches HGTV and is stunned by house hunters shopping for $500,000 homes.\"Theyll pay on those houses forever and ever,\" she says. \"We didnt buy anything unless you could pay cash for it.\"Its that sort of responsibility and practicality that courses through this ranching communitys veins.Assessing life hereRoughly 150 ranches dot the county, most of them passed down through families. Its an area where the first homesteaders arrived in the 1880s, tried to farm and failed. The sandy soil worked against them but proved a sweet spot for cattlemen, who snatched up tracts of land.The ranches are private and sit far off the main roads, in some cases miles off, and are impossible to assess by driving past. Ask a rancher about the size of his land or his herd, and hell keep those numbers to himself.The question is uncouth, explains Dan Vinton, a lifetime rancher and longtime county commissioner; its like prying into a persons salary.\"We have enough grass to feed the cows,\" says Vinton, 66. \"We have enough cows to take care of the grass.\"Dan Vinton, a lifetime rancher and longtime county commissioner, knows that this life isnt for everyone. \"Its pretty hard for the city person to adjust to the country lifestyle,\" he says. \"You cant just jump into your car and go to Walmart.\"Over chicken-fried steak in the Hyannis Hotel Restaurant, one of a handful of businesses on Main Street, Vinton and fellow Commissioner Tom White -- who worked in the feed business and is married to Ellen, the museum volunteer -- regale me with their own stories of growing up in Grant County.They didnt have electricity till the 1950s, got up and went to sleep along with the sun and like to say they \"had running water because you had to run and get it.\" They took Saturday night baths in the same water used by their siblings.\"We didnt know we were stinky little buggers because we all smelled the same,\" White, 71, says with a laugh.Life here has always made sense to them, no matter the challenges. When White needed chemo and radiation to treat cancer a couple months back, he and his wife simply rented an apartment near the hospital in Scottsbluff, more than 100 miles away, for five weeks. Theyll travel to Denver for his upcoming surgery.They arent city folk and dont want to be. Vinton drives that point home when he admits he and his wife have cell phones only so they can find each other when they get separated in the Walmart, which is well over an hour from home.Vintons son works at the family ranch and is on Obamacare. His folks and the Whites arent on it themselves, but they look forward to the day when its abolished. They hear people complain about rates rising and call the program \"ridiculous.\"Not wanting to be dependentA 31-year-old woman sits in the restaurant beside her towheaded boy. To her, Obamacare is maddening, and she unleashes her frustration.Shes a college grad who does her research. When she and her husband got married, they picked out a policy and were happy. But then, Obamacare changed everything.They could no longer afford the private plan they liked. The number of companies she could choose from on the Obamacare exchange dwindled; only two choices exist today. They switched to one company only to see it get absorbed by another. They watched their premiums and deductibles increase, along with out-of-pocket expenses. Theyve been on four plans in two years.Shes married to a rancher, and in ranching, its hard to estimate how much a person will earn each year. When cows sell high, ranchers do well. But, as in any market, the numbers fluctuate. One year, her family might make $20,000; another $50,000, she says. Financial uncertainty makes planning a crapshoot.A stunning thing happened, though, when she got pregnant with her son. Suddenly, she was told she qualified for Medicaid, a notion that made her Republican head spin.\"I want to be responsible for myself. I dont want to be dependent,\" says the woman, who didnt want her name used. \"But you priced me out of what I did to take care of myself and forced me into government assistance.\"Pregnancies only last so long, though, and she doesnt meet the Nebraska Medicaid qualifications for parents. That means shes back to fretting about what this years premiums will be.\"I have to get knocked up,\" she says, half joking, half disgusted. \"Mama needs dental care.\"Fans turned foesAcross the street in the grocery store, I spot Clarissa \"Casey\" Sanchez working behind the counter. She was a fan of Obamacare at first.Paying $50 a month for herself was both doable and a source of comfort for the 30-year-old employee.But then she got married. With their combined gross incomes, she says, her monthly premium jumped to more than $600, and they make too much to qualify for Medicaid. Her husband has his own private policy, but she says she cant join it because shes pregnant. He bought the low-premium policy before Obamacare, and it doesnt include maternity coverage.Sanchez is determined to take care of herself but feels punished for trying. Shes 13 weeks pregnant, scared and crossing her fingers.\"Im going without insurance and hope Trump does something quick,\" she tells me.Nearby, working at a cash register, Julie Braun, 36, chimes in: \"I got married to get off Obamacare.\"Julie Braun, 36, says she was so disappointed in Obamacare that she got married to get off it.She, too, once enjoyed low premiums -- just $30 a month -- only to see them soar. She needed two ankle surgeries last year, and with a high deductible, copays, therapies, braces and boots -- which arent covered -- she says shes staring down a $20,000 bill she cant pay. She makes $9 an hour and even with her husbands salary plans to file for medical bankruptcy.Though Braun and her husband had intended to marry at some point, they moved up their wedding date by a couple years. He teaches in the school and has good benefits, and that was all she needed to rush down the aisle.A scam and racketPeople here say theyve had it with Washington and \"mealy-mouthed politicians,\" the sort who speak pretty but say nothing, one local explains. This is why they backed Trump en masse. They like that he has a business record and trust that he can do better by them.\"The man didnt get rich as he is by being stupid,\" says one man who refuses to give his name but pulls me aside to tell his own story.Hes 50 and has never paid for health insurance. He calls the health care system \"a scam and a racket.\" When he had a cracked tooth not long ago -- the first dental problem hed ever had -- the dentist told him it would cost more than $4,000 to fix. \"For one tooth!\" he exclaims.So he looked at the dentist and asked how much it would cost to pull out all his teeth and give him fake ones instead. It was half the price, so he came back with his checkbook and had every tooth yanked.He now says hes facing a stiff penalty for not having insurance, which enrages him.\"I pay for my own medical, and now I have to pay for someone elses?\" he says. \"Dont get me wrong; I want to do my part. But when does my part stop?\"Garden of EdenThe Sandhills Oil Company gas station -- just \"the station\" to locals -- is a popular gathering spot where people gab over coffee.Robin Jameson, 56, sits in the corner office. She moved here to oversee the station, one of several in a family business portfolio.\"It felt like home immediately,\" she says. She likes how people watch out for one another, donating propane and groceries to those in need, and she gives back in her own way.An old rancher strolls into her office, seeking help deciphering a credit card bill. Retired ranchers down the road visit whenever their grandson competes in out-of-town rodeos, so she can set them up on a computer to watch the live-stream.Woody Thompson sits in the station and over coffee talks about his \"Garden of Eden.\"One of the regulars at a station table is Woody Thompson, 76. He landed in this area more than 60 years ago, when he came out of the Dust Bowl looking for work. He says he was brought here by \"a drunk and a horse thief.\"For decades, he worked on ranches. Its been a life rich in independence and great neighbors, the sort who once kept reselling a white leghorn rooster to raise money for a friend dying of brain cancer. These qualities made even the toughest days worthwhile. Digging harnesses out of snow drifts, riding miles and miles in 30-below temperatures, the winter of 78-79 when the ground never saw less than 3 feet of snow -- he wouldnt take back his time here for anything.\"It might not be heaven, but its the Garden of Eden,\" Thompson says.A heart problem eventually took him away from ranching. Twice a month, he drives 70 miles south to see his Denver cardiologist, who meets him in Ogallala -- the nearest town on the nearest interstate. (Locals like that the interstate runs through flat Nebraska, allowing them to keep their hills to themselves.)Thompson, who moved to Hyannis 15 years ago, hands over one of his business cards. Hes now a traveling rep for a company that performs castrations. With a couple golf balls in a bag, he demonstrates how theyre done.Like so many people in this county, he says that Trumps business know-how spoke to him -- even if he doesnt suspect that hed like the guy personally.\"I have three daughters,\" Thompson says. \"If Megyn Kelly had been my daughter, I would have beat the hell out of him.\"Respecting the lawA couple blocks uphill, in the old courthouse, I find Christee Haney. Shes in her second term as county clerk and keeps official records in the same books and logs used by clerks in the late 1800s.When she was elected seven years ago, it was to fill multiple offices. In an area as rural as this, shes more than the country clerk. Shes also the county assessor, the registrar of deeds, the clerk of the court and the election commissioner.Party registration doesnt dictate votes here, where 81% of registered voters cast ballots in November. She has 40 registered Democrats, she says, but only 20 people voted for Hillary Clinton. Haneys cousin is one example; shes a Democrat who voted for Trump and refused to back Obama, whom she never trusted.Haney, 54, considers the high rate of Obamacare enrollment in Grant County and offers this: People are abiding by the law, simple as that.\"Its a matter of respect out here, and thats what weve all taught our kids,\" she says.Christee Haney, the Grant County clerk and more, writes in the same logs used in the late 1800s.The K-12 school in Hyannis, which serves several counties and has fewer than 150 students, is a source of pride here. The teacher-to-student ratio is 1-to-9, the principal tells me. Students are more than cowboys and cowgirls: They test above the national average, are given their own laptops, flourish in the arts and play sports that draw the community together.Parents whove raised kids here brag about them getting scholarships; one proud dad says his daughter turned down Stanford, MIT and Yale because she wanted to be a Cornhusker. She graduated from the University of Nebraska with perfect grades.People here may not have what big cities offer, but that suits them. When Haney takes a day to run errands in Ogallala, population 4,570 , she finds the traffic and all the people exhausting.She and others here prefer this quiet life with wide-open spaces and fewer stresses. They arent facing a drug epidemic and dont worry about crime. They leave their keys in the ignition and dont lock their doors. They dont have a homeless problem and dont fret about unemployment. If anyone wants to work, theres work to be had.The folks in Grant County wish people elsewhere would take responsibility in their own lives and stop blaming others for their problems.\"People on welfare in big cities make more money not working than we do working,\" says one woman. Shes not the only one I meet who believes this.Not wanting to go withoutIn a small house on the north side of the tracks, where the railroad carries coal from Wyoming and Montana, Terry Keys feeds and burps his 3-month-old son, Deacon.The baby shouldnt be this old. He was born two months early, when severe preeclampsia sent Terry, 34, and his wife, Trish, on an emergency trip to Lincoln at the end of October. Trish and Deacon had to stay there for a month until it was safe to bring the baby home. Terry, who helps drill and service wells, drove more than 300 miles each way to join them on weekends.Trish, the villages 37-year-old salon owner, curls up in the chair beside her husband and son and recounts an odyssey shes still processing.The couple, both Trump supporters, had been uninsured when Obamacare came along. The first year, they paid a penalty of $90. But fearing the prospect of steeper fines, they signed up. With the Affordable Care Act, they could purchase what had previously evaded them for about $150 a month.\"It was reasonable, and we didnt have insurance before,\" Trish says. It helped them, she says, until it didnt.Trish Keys, with 3-month-old Deacon, is fighting to untangle how she ended up with a $104,000 medical bill for her son, who was born two months early.Shed been told their policy would cover Deacon and the exorbitant neonatal intensive care expenses for the first 30 days of his life \"no matter what.\" But she says the insurance company stopped the familys policy without notice. Trish and Terry found out only when they stepped into a pharmacy in Lincoln for flu shots and were told they had no coverage.A panicked phone call later, she was told they qualified for Medicaid and should apply, which meant a flurry of paperwork and bureaucracy. After the trauma of having a preemie and being stuck in a city far from the world she knows, Trish came home to the stress of fighting a $104,000 bill. She still isnt sure whos responsible -- Medicaid or the insurance company -- and only knows she and Terry wont be able to pay it.\"There has to be a simpler way. I feel like theyve overcomplicated everything,\" she says.\"Its mind-boggling to me,\" she says before turning her gaze to her son, who finally weighs 9 pounds. \"Now that this has happened, you dont want to go without insurance.\"She hopes to still be able to afford it.

But that term is outdated and inaccurate, experts say.What spurs offenders into action is rarely animosity alone. Its a toxic mix of emotions, from anger to fear to indignation. And, as the FBI says , \"hate itself is not a crime.\" Instead, bias is considered an \"added element\" to offenses like murder, arson and vandalism, leading at times to longer prison sentences.The public and prosecutors often disagree on what constitutes a hate crime. Besieged minorities like Muslims and transgender people often see an assault on one of them as an attack on their entire community, especially in this era of intense rancor and fear. Between the November election and February, for instance, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted more than 1,300 \"hate incidents\" across the country.But how do prosecutors determine the role hate had in a given crime? For more than two decades, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have relied on a somewhat obscure study to help spot bias in criminal offenses.In 1993, Jack McDevitt and Jack Levin, two social scientists in Boston, examined 169 hate-crime case files at the Boston Police Department. They then interviewed victims, offenders and investigators. McDevitt and Levin found that there are four main kinds of hate crimes, ranging from thrill-seekers, the most common; to \"mission-offenders,\" the rare but often lethal hardcore hatemongers.Knowing the differences between the types of hate crimes -- and their motivations -- not only helps law enforcement better understand them, McDevitt said, it also helps find perpetrators and put them in prison. \"If they know the motivation,\" he told CNN, \"they know where to look.\"Here are the four categories of hate-crimes, along with some examples, many of which are hypotheticals taken from the FBIs training manual on recognizing and collecting data on hate crimes:Thrill-seekingThese hate crimes are often driven by an immature itch for excitement and drama. Think bored and drunk young men marauding through neighborhoods, mayhem on their minds.Often there is no real reason for these crimes, experts say. Theyre committed for the thrill of it, and the victims are vulnerable simply because their sexual, racial, ethnic, gender or religious background differs from that of their attackers.Often the attackers think society doesnt care about the victims -- or worse, will applaud their assault.The attackers may be young, but they are dangerous. In McDevitts study, 70% of these \"thrill offenses\" were assaults, including vicious beatings that put victims in the hospital.That said, the attackers animosity toward their victims, who are chosen at random, can be relatively low, which at least offers the opportunity for rehabilitation.Examples: A group of teens breaks into an LGBT center, destroys property and scrawls anti-gay graffiti on the walls. A street gang assaults a Hindu man while yelling anti-Hindu epithets. A group of men viciously attack men leaving a well-known gay bar, yelling \"Sissy!\" and \"Girlie-man!\"DefensiveIn these hate crimes, the attackers sees themselves as \"defending\" their turf: their neighborhood, their workplace, their religion or their country.Unlike thrill-seekers, who invade other neighborhoods and attack without warning, \"defenders\" target specific victims and justify their crimes as necessary to keep threats at bay. Many times, they are triggered by a particular event, such as a Muslim or black family moving into a new neighborhood.Like thrill-seekers, the \"defenders\" show little or no remorse for their attacks and believe that most, if not all of society supports them but is too afraid to act.\"They honestly believe that what theyre doing has some sort of communal assent,\" said Brian Levin, who leads the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.Examples: A group home for people with psychiatric disabilities is set on fire by a man heard to say, \"Ill get rid of those crazies.\" A transgender woman is attacked near her home by men who yell, \"We dont want no queers in this neighborhood!\" A Japanese man is attacked by a white man who called him an anti-Asian epithet and complained that the Japanese are taking jobs away from Americans.RetaliatoryThese hate crimes are often seen as revenge, whether in response to personal slights, other hate crimes or terrorism.The \"avengers,\" who often act alone, target members of the racial, ethnic or religious group who they believe committed the original crime -- even if the victims had nothing to do with it. They care only about revenge, and they will travel to the victims territory to enact it.These eye-for-an-eye attacks spike after acts of terrorism, a bitter backlash that often targets Muslim Americans. After the 9/11 attacks, for example, hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims rose by 1,600%. A similar spike occurred after the Paris attacks in 2015.Occasionally, members of the same religion or racial group target each other.Ohio prosecutors, for example, charged members of a breakaway Amish sect with hate crimes after they violently cut off the beards of a rival sect. An appeals court overturned the hate crimes conviction, though, ruling that religion had been a significant but not prime motivation behind the assaults.Examples: A woman fires gun shots into the mens locker room of a fitness center, saying she hates men for rejecting her. Hours after Islamic extremists launch a terrorist attack in Europe, someone defaces an American mosque with graffiti that says \"Go home, terrorists!\"Mission offendersThese are the deadliest -- and rarest -- types of hate crimes. They are committed by people who consider themselves \"crusaders,\" often for a racial or religious cause. Their mission: total war against members of a rival race or religion. They are often linked to groups that share their racist views.Mission offenders write lengthy manifestos explaining their views, visit websites steeped in hate speech and violent imagery, and travel to target symbolically significant sites while seeking to maximize carnage.\"Mission offenders believe that the system is rigged against them, which means that they can justify excessive violence against innocents,\" said Levin.These hate crimes can look a lot like terrorism, and scholars say mission offenses often overlap both definitions, as in the case of a Muslim man who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last year. Former President Barack Obama called the massacre both \"an act of terror and an act of hate.\"Examples: Mission offenders tend to become infamous. According to criminologists, they include Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, Charleston church shooter Dylan Roof and Omar Mateen, who massacred 49 people at gay nightclub in Orlando.What can be done?McDevitt acknowledges limits to these categories. Crimes rarely fit cleanly into one or the other. \"Some people have multiple motivations. They may feel defensive, but also that its fun to go and harass someone.\"Edward Dunbar, a psychologist who has written widely about hate crimes, said the categories are valuable for training police and prosecutors but cant predict or prevent bias-motivated attacks.\"To assess patterns of violence, or look at issues like capacity to benefit from rehabilitation, or to consider the evidence of premeditation, the typology is not the way to go.\"Still, the categories help communities learn how to respond to hate crimes, McDevitt and other experts say.Many hate-crime offenders believe that society supports their violent prejudices. The Internet, with its hives of hate groups, has fed that feeling, especially with the ascendancy of the alt-right during the 2016 presidential election.Its crucial for communities -- and politicians -- to clearly and unequivocally condemn hate crimes. McDevitt said that when he interviewed victims, they tended to want three things:1) A statement from public officials denouncing the crime and the beliefs that inspired it.2) For law officers to take the crime -- and their duty to protect the vulnerable -- seriously.3) For communities to value them and make clear they dont share the animosity that triggered the hate crimes.In other words, behind every hate crime is a message: You are not welcome here.Behind every strong community is another: Yes, you are.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/06/02/us/who-commits-hate-crimes/index.html"}, {"title": "Understanding why a visa can be so coveted and reviled", "data_published": "2017-06-05T01:28:55Z", "content": "(CNN) I did not arrive in America as a refugee or to join family already here. I owe the start to my life in this country to two things: my fathers brilliant mind and a very special document.Daddy was a statistician renowned in his field of probability theory, and in 1975, Florida State University offered him a teaching position. We flew across the globe on Indian passports and gained entry into America with a visa called H-1, reserved for people such as my father who possessed distinctive skills.We later applied for permanent residency, my father went on to become a professor emeritus at FSU and in 2008, I proudly became a US citizenThe H-1 visa was designed to attract smart people who were considered the best and the brightest of global talent to fill the gaps in the US workforce. I am a direct beneficiary of that program. Without it, my own trajectory would have been very different.In 1990, the visa was reinvented as H-1B, and it boomed alongside the rise of Silicon Valley. Most H-1Bs are awarded to technology workers, though other fields such as science and medicine also benefit. And these days, almost 70% of the visas are awarded to Indian nationals.Without the H-1B program, argue its supporters, innovation is sure to suffer and America stands to lose its competitive edge. Look at any number of start-ups, and youre sure to find talented folks who reached America on an H-1B. Among that elite group is Mike Krieger , one of the founders of Instagram.But in recent years, abuses and fraud in Americas largest guest worker program have surfaced. And now with Donald Trump in the White House, H-1B is facing fresh scrutiny.In April, Trump signed a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order that is part of his ambitious plan to restore 25 million American jobs. The President blames H-1B visa holders for stealing US jobs, and his order takes aim at the program. The visas, he said, \"should never, ever be used to replace Americans.\"The criticism fits neatly into prevailing anti-immigrant rhetoric, even though H-1Bs are not for immigrants. And to be clear, many H-1B opponents say they dont support building walls or taking other measures to keep foreigners out.I read Trumps harsh words and wondered: How could a visa responsible for my own familys success come under so much fire? When did a perfectly legitimate guest worker system become so controversial? Who wins? Who loses? Has it really become bad for America?Intrigued, I decided to learn more about the H-1B visa.My conversations led me to other Indian Americans, and some of their comments surprised me. I reached out to a congressman from Silicon Valley, a CEO of a tech company who refuses to hire H-1B workers, and a technology worker who lost a fulfilling job and is running for Congress to change the system. I even spoke with an H-1B worker from my native India whose story I found heartbreaking.I learned there were no simple answers to my questions. What I do know is the H-1B visa has become a document coveted by thousands around the globe -- and reviled by just as many in the United States.A losing lottery?To understand how the H-1B visa system works, I called one of the nations foremost experts on the subject: Ronil Hira.Hira, an associate professor of public policy at Howard University, t estified last year before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the impact of H-1B workers. He began with his personal story, one that is not unlike mine.He was the son of immigrants who left India in the 1950s to seek a better life. His wifes family also arrived in the United States on the same H-1 visa program as my father.The idea behind H-1B is the same as it was when my father obtained his H-1. Its still employer-sponsored and temporary -- the H-1B is good for three years and is extendable for another three. After that, the holder has to return home unless the employer sponsors him or her for permanent residency -- better known as a green card.Each year, US Citizenship and Immigration Services issues 65,000 H-1B visas to applicants with bachelors degrees for \"specialty occupations.\" Another 20,000 are set aside for those with masters degrees or higher from a US university.JUST WATCHED H-1B visas by the numbers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH H-1B visas by the numbers 01:16Those caps, mandated by Congress, were as high as 195,000 in the early 2000s, and many in the tech industry would like to see them rise again.\"The single stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on H-1B visas,\" Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Googles parent company Alphabet, recently told an MIT audience. \"A properly run company is really about having the best people.\"The demand for the visas remains high and the competition, intense.This year, on the morning of April 1, the first-come, first-served application process opened like the gates to a horse race. Four days later, it was over. The USCIS had received 199,000 visa petitions from employers -- way more than enough to meet the statutory caps.Because of the high number of applications, the visas are then allotted by lottery.Thats where the trouble begins. If the intent is to get the highest-skilled workers to fill \"specialty occupations,\" why is the government using an arbitrary method such as the lottery? Although everyone in the lottery is theoretically qualified, chances are some better-qualified applicants will lose out to those with less skill and experience.Another problem: Employers are supposed to seek a foreign worker only when they cannot find a qualified American for the job. But thats not how it works, Hira tells me.Large firms unfairly snag a chunk of H-1B visas by flooding the application pool. They include familiar names such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, but the biggest recipients are outsourcing companies like Cognizant and Accenture and Indian giants Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, the two top recipients of H-1B visas.Employers must make a good-faith effort to recruit an American worker for a position before seeking an H-1B visa, but they dont have to document their efforts.\"The actual rules dont require companies to look for American workers and specialized skills,\" Hira says. \"The definitions have gotten loose. Everything in the system is written in favor of the employers.\"The big companies have figured out how to play the visa game and take advantage of loopholes, Hira says. And the smaller companies, the ones that are more in need of specialized labor, are often out of luck.The main reason American companies hire H-1B workers through outsourcing firms, Hira says, is to save money. A whole lot of it.Employers are suppopesed to pay H-1B workers a \"prevailing wage\" based on the job and location. But Hiras research found that employers were recruiting H-1B labor at entry-level wages, not the average wage for specific jobs.Infosys or Tata can save a company up to $45,000 per worker every year, according to Hiras analysis.In 2013, for instance, Infosys snared almost 7,000 H-1B visas. The median wage it paid was $70,882, about $20,000 lower than a computer systems analyst in Rosemead, California. Thats the home of Southern California Edison, a utility that replaced more than 300 American IT workers with H-1B workers employed by Infosys. Hira cites a compensation study that showed Edison IT specialists were earning an average annual base pay of $110,446.The lower salaries at Infosys and other outsourcing firms are still attractive to thousands of tech workers in India, who average only $6,000 a year and clamor for an opportunity to work in the United States.Neeraj Gupta came from India to America as a graduate student and then was hired on an H-1B by a Silicon Valley firm, which later sponsored his green card. Gupta went on to found his own tech company, which was ultimately acquired by an Indian outsourcing firm.In 2009, after witnessing the offshoring of jobs, Gupta began looking into solutions that would create American jobs in technology services.\"With respect to President Trump, there is truth in what he is saying,\" Gupta tells me. \"The premise of the visa is accurate. The challenge is how it has been hijacked by the IT outsourcing industry.\"Hira, too, believes the good intent of H-1B has been overrun by corporations that cannot see beyond their profit margins.He was in favor of H-1B, he told the Senate committee last year. But it was imperative to fix a broken system.\"High-skilled immigration has directly benefited my family enormously,\" Hira told lawmakers. Then, he issued this warning:\"Thousands of American jobs will be offshored. Tens of thousands of American workers will have their wages depressed. And thousands of American students will be denied opportunities. Thats one lottery American workers and students are guaranteed to lose.\"Laid off and forced to train his replacementCraig Diangelo lost big to H-1B.At first, he kept quiet, in line with an agreement he signed to not disparage his employer. But he was so incensed by the injustice at his workplace he could not stay silent.Not only did Diangelo, 65, lose his job to a less-skilled, lower-paid foreign worker, but he was forced to train his replacement or face losing his severance.Craig Diangelo lost his job at Northeast Utilities and had to train his replacement, an H-1B worker.Hed worked in information technology all his life, but the sudden job loss dimmed his future considerably. So much so, that Diangelo is now running for office.Frustrated by the inaction of lawmakers to reform Americas guest worker program, Diangelo is running as a Republican to unseat Democrat Elizabeth Esty in Connecticuts 5th Congressional District.\"I would like the law to change,\" Diangelo says. \"You cannot bring over an H-1B worker to replace an American.\"Diangelo had always wanted to be a schoolteacher, but after finishing his degree in education in the mid-1970s he couldnt find a job. Instead he went to work for Travelers Insurance Cos. in Hartford, Connecticut.He began as a COBOL programmer, and his career evolved over the decades as the tech industry changed. In his last full-time position at Northeast Utilities in Berlin, Connecticut, Diangelo helped support the companys storage architecture. He made $130,000 a year.\"It was a wonderful job,\" he tells me. \"It paid me well. I worked with a great group of people.\"That began unraveling when a merger with a smaller company led to changes in management. In October 2013, the new managers gathered the 220 employees in Diangelos unit and bluntly announced that their jobs were going to Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services.\"Why were we not given the first rights to re-apply for our jobs?\" Diangelo says. \"Why was I not given the opportunity to go to Infosys and say: I would like to apply for this position? \"To make matters worse, Diangelo was told he would have to engage in \"knowledge transfer\" and train his Indian replacement.\"I was in complete disbelief,\" he says. \"I gave my soul to this company. They had been good to me. It didnt make any sense.\"He was told his last day would be in December, but that was extended to March and then to May when his employers realized the replacement workers were not ready. They were not high-skilled employees filling a job for which no Americans were available, as was the intent of H-1B.\"They were lower-skilled workers,\" Diangelo says. \"We had to train them from scratch. My replacement was making half of what I was making. And he had no benefits.\"Id met Infosys employees when I visited the companys shiny Googlesque campus in Bangalore, India, several years ago. They told me how IT jobs had opened up opportunities, changed their lives. For the first time in generations, their families aspired to so much more in life.Tech companies are a point of pride in my homeland. The industry is the largest private sector employer in India and constitutes about 10% of the gross domestic product. Technology is a big reason why India arrived as a major player on the global stage.I knew there was a mad rush to apply for H-1B visas at Infosys and other outsourcing firms. But what I did not realize is that these eager Indians were putting Americans out of work.From Diangelo, I was hearing the ugly side of Indian tech.Northeast Utilities employees put up US flags in cubicles after realizing they would lose their jobs to H-1B workers.I contacted Infosys and Tata for comment. Tata did not respond. An Infosys spokesman told me the company was not granting any interviews regarding H-1B visas. He did, however, send me this statement:\"We continue to invest in the local communities in which we operate, including hiring local American top talent, bringing education and training to our clients to shrink the skills gap in the US, and working with policymakers to foster innovation within states and across the country. It is our endeavor to help clients leverage the best US talent together with the best global talent.\"Diangelo says he found it humiliating, depressing even, that he had to stay on -- with his Infosys replacement -- at a job he knew would soon vanish for him. But he and his colleagues were older workers close to the top of their salary grades. He knew it would be hard to find employment elsewhere. He had few options.Diangelo trained his replacement in Connecticut as well as 11 other workers in India. The company, he says, recorded his webinars, and he guesses his training sessions have been used many times since his departure.This is how it sometimes works: Indian H-1B workers are brought in to replace workers here in America, but subsequently many of the jobs are moved offshore to India.Diangelo and his colleagues on the second floor of the Northeast Utilities building put up small US flags on their cubicles. As each completed a last day at work, a flag came down. Diangelo was the last. When he returned after a weekend to turn in his company badge, only his flag remained. Then, that, too, was gone.I asked for an interview with a manager at Northeast Utilities, now called Eversource Energy, and was sent a statement via e-mail:\"Three years ago we made strategic changes to our IT department to support the merger of two companies and keep pace with changing technologies to better serve our customers,\" the statement read. \"As an electric and gas delivery business, we did not have the internal capabilities to efficiently meet the growing technology needs of the larger, combined company.\"Eversource, said the statement, uses Infosys and Tata to perform some of its IT functions, and that employees such as Diangelo who were affected were offered comprehensive severance packages, career transition and training services and extended health care coverage.This has nothing to do with immigration. We have a bill out there that allows foreign workers to take American jobs. Craig DiangeloEversource is hardly the only US entity that has been accused of laying off Americans in favor of cheaper Indian labor.Employees at the University of California, San Francisco, had to train their replacements from an outsourcing firm. So did technology workers at Walt Disney World, New York Life, Toys R Us and Southern California Edison.And these are just the cases that have surfaced publicly because of lawsuits and employees such as Diangelo who risked losing their severance by speaking out.Diangelo says he holds nothing against his replacement worker from Infosys, nothing against immigrants. He blames the system that allows this to happen.This year, he watched as the H-1B application date of April 1 approached. He had counted on Trump to put a moratorium on the visas. But now, he says, 85,000 more foreign workers will arrive in the United States in the coming months.\"That means another 85,000 Americans will lose their jobs,\" he says.\"Every time I talk to my senators and congressmen, they say we need a comprehensive immigration bill,\" he says. \"But these are two separate things. This has nothing to do with immigration. We have a bill out there that allows foreign workers to take American jobs.\"\"The government needs to make changes to the H-1B program,\" he says. \"Even the lawmakers who made this law say it has been hijacked.\"Diangelo is referring to Bruce Morrison, a former Connecticut congressman who sponsored legislation creating the H-1B visa system but is now a vocal critic.Several bills that aim to reform H-1B have been introduced in both the House and Senate this year. One of the co-sponsors of a House bill is Rep. Ro Khanna, an Indian-American from Californias 17th Congressional District in the south San Francisco Bay Area and the heart of Silicon Valley.Again, I thought of my own family as I read Khannas bio. He was born in Philadelphia to parents who immigrated in the 1970s from India. Because of his background and because he represents so many who work in the tech industry, Khanna has taken heat for his stance on H-1B.Please note: Ro Khanna, an Indian American politician funded heavily by NRIs, is championing restrictions on H1B: https://t.co/glRDDlYtLG — Rajiv Malhotra (@RajivMessage) March 3, 2017Khanna tells me his Silicon Valley voters understand the need for reform. He says that as the son of immigrants, he understands the contributions of people who come from other lands. But their contributions cannot come at the expense of American workers.\"We need change so you dont have underpaid foreigners taking away American jobs,\" he says. \"This bill is pro-immigrant and pro-American worker.\"At the end of my conversation with Diangelo, he tells me the Infosys H-1B employee he trained wanted to be his friend.\"I couldnt allow myself to do that. I did not have hard feelings against him. But he was taking my job.\"Diangelo took early retirement; he did not want to transition into a new career so late in life and eventually found contract work in IT. Many of his co-workers, he says, are still unemployed.\"We dont go out as much or give to charities,\" he says of himself and his former colleagues. \"It has a downward spiral effect. A long-lasting one. It affects the morale of people.\"Every time he pumps gas at his local Costco, he looks up at the Eversource compound on a hill and thinks: My job is still there.Employees on the Bangalore, India, campus of Infosys, a tech giant that is one of the top recipients of H-1B visas.Growing demandOn a recent morning, I visit Monty Hamilton, CEO of Rural Sourcing Inc., a technology outsourcing company based in Atlanta.There are no H-1B workers here. It goes against the mission of the company, Hamilton tells me.Hamilton grew up in a two-stoplight town in Mississippi. When he chose vocation over location, he was forced to chase his dreams in a big city. He began his career with Accenture, another big recipient of H-1B visas, before taking the reins at Rural Sourcing in 2008.The companys goal was to find smart IT employees, not in foreign countries but in secondary US cities outside Silicon Valley: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Mobile, Alabama; Augusta, Georgia.\"We do need to import some talent, but we need to do a better job in training the US workforce to get into this field that is changing so fast,\" he says.Though he wont hire H-1B workers, Hamilton says its folly to think the visas can be done away with altogether.His fifth-floor office overlooks the campus of Georgia Tech. He tells me that all the foreign students who are about to graduate will be forced to go home unless they find employer-sponsored H-1B or other visas.\"Why in the hell would we allow that?\" Hamilton says.America has 500,000 tech jobs open today, he tells me. And only 43,000 students who graduated with computer science degrees last year, he says, citing Code.org.\"How long does it take to fill a tech job? An average of 65 days. That tells me there is a shortage,\" Hamilton says.Whether or not there truly is a shortage is the subject of much debate, I discovered. It often depends on the interpretation of statistics.I read a petition that entrepreneurs including Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook co-signed with educators, nonprofits and governors from both political parties urging increased computer science education. \"There are currently over 500,000 open computing jobs, in every sector, from manufacturing to banking, from agriculture to healthcare, but only 50,000 computer science graduates a year,\" the letter said.But I also read an Economic Policy Institute analysis that found American colleges graduate 50% more students in engineering and computer and information science than are hired in those fields each year.Shortage or not, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted the number of technology jobs will rise from 3.9 million in 2014 to about 4.4 million in 2024. Part of the demand for tech jobs is due to the growing \"Internet of things,\" including cloud and mobile computing.\"Technology is changing fast,\" Hamilton says. \"We do need to import some talent, but we also need to do a better job in training the US workforce.\"I leave Hamiltons office and come across a group of young Indian engineering students enrolled at Georgia Tech. They tell me they want nothing more than to stay here for a job. If they dont get one right away, they will go home and try to return with an H-1B visa.They talk about it as though it were a coveted prize, a ticket to success.JUST WATCHED Indian official says H-1B visas bolster jobs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Indian official says H-1B visas bolster jobs 01:31TechsploitationFor days, I ponder something Craig Diangelo told me. He realized his Indian H-1B replacement was also in a difficult position -- he had no idea he was going to America to take someone elses job.H-1B workers brought over by outsourcing firms often dont know the circumstances they are about to face. They, too, are part of an abusive system, say H-1B critics.The exploitation of Indian H-1B workers essentially amounts to indentured servitude, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting, which exposed what one worker called \"an ecosystem of fear.\"In a class-action lawsuit filed in California, H-1B workers described staffing agencies known as \"body shops\" that enticed workers to the United States and filed for their H-1B visas. Instead, when they arrived, the workers were huddled together in cramped \"guest houses\" and paid no wages until they were placed with a technology firm.H-1B workers described having to pay the staffing agencies, pay for travel to jobs in other states and falling into debt before they even earned a penny.Because H-1B visas are sponsored by companies, the employees are beholden to them. They risk losing their jobs and being sent back to India if they complain too loudly.\"Its human trafficking. They are being bought and sold,\" says Jack \"Jay\" Palmer, a former Infosys employee who brought a whistleblower lawsuit against the technology giant in 2012 alleging visa fraud.Palmer accused Infosys of illegally using business visitor visas known as B-1 to fill positions in the United States. The B-1 visas are easier to obtain and have lower fees than H-1Bs and are intended for short stays to attend meetings and training sessions.The lawsuit led to a federal investigation, and Infosys eventually agreed to a $34 million civil settlement with the Justice Department.I catch Palmer on the phone as hes driving to the Atlanta airport for a flight to Washington. He says hes meeting with Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and a sponsor of the Senate H-1B reform bill.\"I believe in the American dream. I have nothing against H-1B and green cards,\" Palmer says. \"I just want to see the law enforced.\"A few hours later, I get a call from an Indian man whom Palmer has been helping. He tells me he is from Hyderabad, another technology hub in India, and was sponsored for an H-1B visa by Tata Consultancy Services.He fears repercussions at his job in New York and speaks with me only after I agree to withhold his identity.He says he worked in India for a decade before he came to America on an H-1B and was \"body-shopped.\" He was placed in a job with a published salary of $45 an hour, but after the body shoppers and the outsourcing companies take their share, he only makes about $29.The man is 45 and has a wife and two children -- 8 and 12. His expenses amount to about $5,000 a month, about $1,000 more than what he takes home. He has fallen into debt and no longer has the ability to climb out of it.\"We cannot save any money,\" he says. \"I have $20,000 in credit card debt, and I owe $15,000 for my car.\"\"Why dont you go back home to India?\" I ask him.\"I do not even have money to buy tickets,\" he says.He says he feels lucky, though. At least he is not in a \"guest house\" waiting for work.Life, he says, goes on in limbo.He says he was promised sponsorship for a green card but was asked to pay a $25,000 fee he couldnt afford. I spoke with another Indian H-1B worker in Atlanta who has applied for a green card, but the backlog is so great for Indian citizens that it can take up to 10 years or more. Until then, H-1B workers remain tethered to their employers.\"My dream was to come to America, but I dont want to stay here with this kind of life,\" the man in New York says. \"But I have no choice. I replaced American workers, but I am a victim, too.\"The man in New York is not alone. There are thousands of workers like him, Palmer tells me.Palmer and other H-1B reformers want accountability.They say US companies must be required to document their searches to fill positions with American workers. Employers must pay prevailing wages and be prevented from subcontracting or outsourcing H-1B jobs.Reform advocates are pushing for a system of government enforcement and oversight of the H-1B regulations, not one that is reliant on whistleblowers to expose abuse.Technology is here to stay. And it is changing at warp speed. The demand for smart talent is not going away. Thats why even the biggest critics of H-1B are the most ardent backers of reform, not elimination.What I hear them saying is the system ought to work the way it used to, when my father obtained an H-1 visa. He was hired for a job he was uniquely qualified for, and he was compensated with a decent wage.No one wants to see Americans lose their jobs unfairly, and if my father were still alive, I know hed be troubled by what I learned about the current H-1B program.I also know he would be heartened to see that some of the most ardent backers of visa reform are Indian Americans. After all, we are the ones who have most reaped the rewards of H-1B.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/06/04/us/understanding-the-h-1b-visa/index.html"}, {"title": "From Gandhi to guns: An Indian woman at the NRA", "data_published": "set()", "content": "The author, an Indian-American, visiting her first NRA convention on Friday.Editor’s Note: This story was first published in April, after the author attended an NRA convention. She reflected again on what she heard and saw this week after learning of the Las Vegas massacre on Monday, which was also Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday.Atlanta CNN —Guns are not a part of the culture of my homeland, except perhaps for the occasional Bollywood movie in which the bad guy meets his demise staring down the wrong end of a barrel.My childhood in India was steeped in ahimsa, the tenet of nonviolence toward all living things.The Indians may have succeeded in ousting the British, but we won with Gandhian-style civil disobedience, not a revolutionary war.I grew up not knowing a single gun owner, and even today India has one of the strictest gun laws on the planet. Few Indians buy and keep firearms at home, and gun violence is nowhere near the problem it is in the United States. An American is 12 times more likely than an Indian to be killed by a firearm, according to a recent study.It’s no wonder then that every time I visit India, my friends and family want to know more about America’s “love affair” with guns.I get the same questions when I visit my brother in Canada or on my business travels to other countries, where many people remain perplexed, maybe even downright mystified, by Americans’ defense of gun rights.I admit I do not fully understand it myself, despite having become an American citizen nearly a decade ago. So when I learn the National Rifle Association is holding its annual convention here in Atlanta, right next to the CNN Center, I decide to go and find out more.My eyes open wide inside the vast and cavernous Georgia World Congress Center. I take in countless exhibits by the firearms industry and even check out a few guns. Among them are the Mossberg Blaze .22 semiautomatic Rimfire Rifle and an FN 509 semi-automatic 9mm pistol.I’ve never had the desire to own a gun. I try hard to experience the excitement of others who are admiring these products.Around me are 80,000 of America’s fiercest patriots and defenders of guns. Many are wearing American flag attire and T-shirts with slogans like: “Veterans before refugees” and “God loves guns.”Few people here look like me. Most appear to be white and male. Many view the media, including my employer, with disdain – and they do not hesitate to let me know.I walk around with some trepidation, but I’m determined to strike up conversations. I begin with this question: “Why do you want to own an object that can kill another human being?”The answers are varied, but they center on three main themes: freedom, self-defense and sport. The first type of response is rooted in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows for the ownership of more than 300 million guns in America. How many other countries have the right to bear arms written into their very foundation? It’s unique and because of that, foreigners often have trouble grasping it.I meet Chris Styskal at a booth set up by the NRA Wine Club. Yes, a wine club for the almost 5 million members of the organization.“Eat, sleep, go fishing. Drink, sleep, go shooting. In that order,” Styskal jokes.But then we get into serious talk. Gun ownership, he tells me, has its roots in the birth of this country.“George Washington’s army fought off the British with rifles,” he says. “They overthrew an oppressive government.”His statement gives me pause. The gun laws in India stem from colonial rule, when the British aimed to quell their subjects by disarming them. Perhaps my Indian compatriots should consider the right to own guns from this perspective.Styskal, 41, earned a degree in psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University, and tells me the prevailing belief that gun owners are not educated is simply wrong. He owns a collection of rifles and pistols at his home in Port Carbon, Pennsylvania, and last year he fired 100 rounds every week at a shooting range.He says the Second Amendment is about much more than the right to bear arms. It’s about freedom.“We don’t want any government telling us what we can and cannot do.”It’s a thought echoed by Brickell “Brooke” Clark, otherwise known as the American Gun Chic. She has a website by that name and also a YouTube channel. Both are bathed in hues of pink and dedicated to her recently formed passion for guns.I introduce myself to Clark as we await President Donald Trump’s arrival at the convention. The darkened room is booming with NRA clips bashing everyone from Hillary Clinton to George Clooney.“What would you tell my friends in India who say Americans are infatuated with guns?”“I wouldn’t say Americans have an obsession with guns,” Clark says. “We have an obsession with being free.”I ask what the Second Amendment means to her.“It means I can live my life without anyone overpowering me,” she says. “It makes me equal with everyone else.”The great equalizer. I never thought of the Second Amendment in that way.Self-protection, I discover, is a huge reason many Americans own firearms.Take Chloe Morris. She was born in Atlanta to Filipino parents; on this day, she’s brought her mother along to hear Trump, the first sitting President to speak at an NRA convention since Ronald Reagan.Morris is 35, petite and soft-spoken, but she’s fierce about her opinions on guns.“I’m 5 feet tall and 100 pounds,” she tells me. “I cannot wait for a cop to come save me when I am threatened with rape or death.”Morris was once opposed to guns. “Extremely opposed,” she says.She earned a master’s degree in criminal justice from Georgia State University. “I know the law,” she says. “For me guns were not the answer.”But a few years ago, a dear friend was assaulted in her own home in an upscale Atlanta subdivision. The incident struck fear in Morris. She would never let herself become a victim.She took shooting classes and became a Glock instructor. “I teach for free. I want women to be safe.“I own 10 guns. I have a 14-year-old son. I started teaching him to shoot when he was 5. I’m a lifetime member of the NRA.”She pauses, and her next sentence surprises me.“I don’t think I can even kill another person – except when my life is in danger.”In a way, I understand her position. My first real exposure to guns came after I embedded with the US Army and Marines to report the Iraq War. As a journalist I never carried a weapon, though soldiers coaxed me to learn how to shoot an M16. My conversation with Morris reminded me of a night when we came under threat, and the platoon sergeant placed a 9mm pistol on my Humvee seat. I refused to take it but knew instantly what he was trying to tell me. What if I were the last one alive? How would I save myself?Luckily, we were safe that night. But I’ve always wondered how I might have acted under a dreadful scenario.Other NRA members I speak with also tell me they don’t trust the police to arrive in time when they are in danger. Scott Long, 55, lives out in the country in Piketon, Ohio – 25 miles away from the county sheriff.“The police can’t be there all the time,” he says, looking at his wife, DeeDee, and their three young children, whom he’s brought along to the convention for a mini family vacation. Their son Brody, 9, has been shooting at the pellet range and is excited about his first 20-gauge shotgun.“Where we live, we can shoot in our backyard,” says Long, who owns 25 guns and is enjoying checking out all the shiny new weapons exhibited here.Such remoteness, too, is alien to me. I grew up in a city that now brims with some 16 million people on a working day. Firing guns in my grandfather’s garden would not have been a good thing. I think about all the space we have in America. So many of us live far from other human beings. Like the Long family. Perhaps isolation adds to the need to own guns.I move forward in my quest to know more.I hear gun proponents express a dislike for big government. They stress individual liberties over the collective. For people who live in more socialist countries, it’s another obstacle to understanding American gun culture.Near a stairway emblazoned with a giant Beretta, I speak with Derrick Adams. He’s a 32-year-old electric lineman from Nottingham, Pennsylvania. He describes himself as part black, part Puerto Rican and part Caucasian.“How many guns do you own?” I ask.“Not enough,” he replies.He picked up his first Glock when he was 22, and his first shot shattered a whole bunch of stereotypes.“People look at guns as this evil tool whose job it is to kill,” he says. “They’re not at all that. They are about protection.”Adams believes that if all law-abiding citizens were armed, crime would drastically go down. He tells me that Chicago would not have such a high gun homicide rate if good folks in the inner cities were armed to fight “thugs and gangs.”“Stop looking to government to help us. They are not our parents,” Adams says.Liberals in America who want more gun control, says Adams, want to keep minorities and poor people dependent on government. Gun control started after slavery ended and was a way to keep black people disarmed, he says.“You idiots,” Adams says, referring to all people of color. “It was invented to suppress you.”He looks at me as though to say: You should know better.Again, I think of colonialism in my homeland and how the British passed strict gun control to keep Indians from rising up.Fighting tyranny and oppression is something Jaasiel Rubeck considers, too. The 29-year-old wife and mother from Columbus, Ohio, immigrated to this country from her native Venezuela when she was 6. People who live under authoritarian regimes should all understand the need to own a gun, she tells me.Rubeck’s words remind me of a friend from Iraq who wished she could own a gun during Saddam Hussein’s rule. After he was overthrown, she slept with an AK-47 under her pillow at the height of the insurgency. She has always spoken of her love-hate relationship with guns. She wants to protect her family, but she is tired of the eternal violence plaguing her land. She wishes now that every gun would disappear from Iraq.What I hear from speakers at the NRA convention, though, is that a peaceful world is a utopian fantasy – and that the need for guns will always exist.“The NRA saved the soul of America,” says Chris Cox, the executive director of the organization.I leave the convention trying to reconcile what I’ve gathered on this day with the philosophy of nonviolence with which I was raised. I am not certain that vast cultural differences can be bridged in a few hours, but I am glad I got a glimpse into the world of guns. I have much to consider.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/04/28/world/indian-immigrant-nra-convention/index.html"}, {"title": "Split by Trump's travel ban, a family races to reunite", "data_published": "2017-02-21T21:48:39Z", "content": "(CNN) Abdalla hears his English teachers voice beaming across the room like a ray of sunshine.\"What... is... the... matter?\"The teacher sounds out each syllable, pausing as photos of injuries flash on a projection screen.

Batulo Abdalla Ramadhan, 22, had been scheduled to travel in early February to join her parents and siblings in Atlanta, but Trumps executive order put her plans on hold. Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: Refugees face uncertain journey to US Abdullahi Ali Abdullahi, 31, was to be resettled in Columbus, Ohio, with his family until the travel ban, which was announced two days before they were scheduled to leave. In the interim his medical insurance expired and he cannot travel until it is renewed. \"We may be Muslims, but we have never taken part in terrorist attacks and we dont believe in it,\" he told CNN. Abdullahis family fled Somalia when he was 6, after his grandfather was killed, and he has lived in refugee camps ever since. \"I still have the hope that I will be in America,\" he said. \"I want to do anything that will help develop the United States. I want to do that because theyd be giving me respect to welcome me.\" Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: Refugees face uncertain journey to US Mumina Hassan Aden, who fled to Kenya in 1992 after witnessing three of her uncles killed in Somalia.

Instead, they remained at Kakuma, which is home to some 160,000 refugees. \"Life is about survival here,\" said their mother, Mano Abukar Abdullahi, who has been trying to resettle to the US since 2013. \"I want my children to get a better life than what we have at the camp.\" Hide Caption 8 of 8Only days ago, Abdalla thought America would give his daughter a chance to continue her studies and follow that path.Instead, shes stuck in a refugee camp nearly 8,000 miles away, and hes not sure if shell ever make it.\"I feel,\" Abdalla says, \"like someone cut off my arm.\"A new lifeThe day her family learned theyd be coming to the United States, Batulo was the one who opened the letter.\"Dad, we passed!\" she shouted into the phone.Abdalla was so overjoyed he wanted to run naked through the streets. The years of screenings and interviews were worth it. Finally, after suffering an unspeakable tragedy and spending years on the run, his family would be safe.But for Batulo, the joy was short-lived. Because of her age, shes not considered a dependent minor. Officials separated her case and told her shed travel on her own later.Abdalla tried to reassure his daughter. Theyd just be apart for a matter of days, he told her. Then theyd begin a new life together.That all changed on January 27.The search for safetyDonald Trump was days away from taking the oath of office when Abdalla Ramadhan Munye and Habibo Mohamed landed in the United States. The Somali refugees had seven children in tow -- two daughters, three sons and a niece and nephew theyd been raising for a decade.The family was just settling into their new apartment in the Atlanta suburb of Clarkston when Trump went to the Pentagon and signed an executive order titled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.\"Instead of settling into their new apartment, Somali refugees Habibo Mohamed and Abdalla Ramadhan Munye are fighting to reunite with their daughter.His order blocked refugee arrivals for four months and banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries , including Somalia, for at least 90 days. Those were necessary steps, Trump said, to keep the US safe.Batulo called her parents in tears from Kakuma, the Kenyan refugee camp she thought she was about to leave. Her trip had been canceled.The stroke of a presidents pen that day rewrote the first chapter of this Somali refugee familys life in the United States.Their fresh start became a frantic search for help.Buried aliveBatulo was weaving through the market stalls in Kakuma when she got the call. She had been searching for new shoes for her journey.The official on the other end of the line told her not to bother.\"You are not able to go,\" he said. \"There is no journey taking place.\"Her flight had been canceled because of the new presidential order.She began to cry.Batulo had already given away most of her clothes and books to friends who needed them more. Shed moved in with a family who said she could stay with them while she waited.She thought her flight was just days away.Crowds gather outside the airstrip at Kakuma camp in northwest Kenya, where about 160,000 refugees live.Now, however, a devastating reality is starting to set in: Her life of the past few days -- cooking and cleaning in a home that is not her own, relying on the kindness of a family that is not hers -- might be the only life she has left.With her family gone, the joy has faded away from the world around her. In Kakuma, where shes lived for seven years, she watches the children playing outside, the chickens and goats ambling down the dry dirt roads, the occasional motorcycle rumbling by, sending dust into the air.But that isnt what she sees.\"I just see Kakuma, I just see it, Im just inside the hole,\" she says. \"They are ... burying me while Im alive.\"A presidential pleaTears well up in Habibos eyes as she faces a room full of cameras.She chokes up as she tells reporters about the last conversation she had with her daughter: \"Im afraid she feels I abandoned her.\"Abdalla sits beside his wife, searching for the right words.Speaking through an interpreter, Abdalla says hes afraid something will happen to the daughter they left behind in Kakuma. He begs the US government for help.Speaking through an interpreter at a press conference in suburban Atlanta, Abdalla and Habibo plead for help.Theres one person in particular he hopes will hear his plea: first lady Melania Trump.\"Shes a mother and she knows the love of a child,\" Abdalla says. \"I would like her to do her best to convince the president to change his mind.\"An exodus beginsAbdalla is terrified of losing another daughter. He already lost one.The horrific details of that day in 2004 are still sharp in his mind.How he and his oldest son, Ramadhan, went out to grind corn -- past the mango groves and the river where theyd hide sometimes when violence came to the Somali countryside.How they headed back home and suddenly heard screams.How they realized the screams were coming from inside their house.How he found Habibo crying in a corner and their daughter, Famo, on the ground, covered in blood.How Habibo told him men had stormed into their home, wearing masks and shouting in Somali.How their 11-year-old had been raped and shot between the eyes.How he tried to save her, pulling her in a cart toward the hospital.How people warned him it was too late and told him she was gone.How they were right.How he buried her.How he knew that day that they had to leave Somalia.Keeping his family safe -- and together -- has been Abdallas mission ever since.We are sorryAround the English classroom at the International Rescue Committees Atlanta office, students practice reciting the ailments theyve just learned.On the walls, colorful posters spell out the the days of the week, the seasons of the year and the names of US presidents.Erin Harwood begins her lesson at the International Rescue Committees Atlanta office, where dozens of refugees whove just arrived in the United States are learning English.While her students study, teacher Erin Harwood keys up a different presentation on the projector.The screen shows a picture of Trump at a desk beside a photo of protesters waving signs.\"The president passed a refugee ban for 120 days. ... This word, ban, means stop,\" she tells them. \"Do you know why?\"A student in the middle of the classroom offers an answer: \"Because he didnt know the refugees.\"Harwood nods.\"He is a little afraid. He is afraid about terrorism,\" she says. \"But there are many people who think this is not a good idea. We want you to come here. We are sorry for the danger that he has put you in. And we are sorry for your families.\"She pauses, choking up.\"I am sorry for your families.\"A map flashes across the screen with seven countries highlighted in red. Several people in the classroom cheer when they see their homelands, unaware of why theyve become the subject of this latest lesson.\"Number One Syria!\" yells one man.\"Number One Iraq!\" another counters.But the mood quickly darkens as Harwood explains more about the travel ban. She tells her class that it will be harder -- maybe even impossible -- for refugees to ever come again from those seven countries.A worksheet outlines vocabulary refugees need to know if they go to the doctor.Several women begin to cry. Harwood tries to reassure them.\"You are here legally. You should not be worried,\" she says. \"The problem is for your families who want to come.\"The teacher passes out flyers advertising a community meeting where experts will answer refugees questions about the executive order.Abdalla writes down the address so he wont forget.DisconnectedThe voice of a child singing the ABCs echoes from a toy as 11-year-old Mana plays on the dining room floor. A cell phone video game blares in the living room as 7-year-old Ibrahim races a motorcycle down a track. Plates clank in the kitchen as 20-year-old Asha does the dishes.Theres a stack of shoes outside their front door, with a playground and a pond nearby. Happy families walk hand in hand as they take their children to school.To the outside eye, this three-bedroom apartment in a placid neighborhood is a hive of a activity.But Abdalla sees what isnt there.His phone rings. Its Batulo.Abdalla hands the phone to his youngest son, Ibrahim.When the 7-year-old learned last week that his sister wasnt coming, he bolted out of the apartment and fell on his face. He still has a scrape above his lip.Ibrahim, 7, at right, lights up when he hears his sister Batulos voice on the phone.Batulo reminds him to study and go to school. He smiles.The family passes the phone around the room. Each of them lights up when they hear her voice.Batulo tells her mother she doesnt have enough money to buy textbooks for school.Then suddenly, the connection goes dark.Everyone in the apartment freezes, like parts of a machine that halt when a gear stops turning.The distant sounds of car horns and children laughing filter through the open front door.But inside the apartment, quiet sniffles are the only sounds.Habibo knows the signal is often spotty in the refugee camp. But any time a call gets disconnected, shes terrified.She uses her bright yellow hijab to wipe away her tears, curls up on the couch and waits for her daughter to call back.Looking for helpBatulo uses a plate to fan the flames beneath a pot on the dirt floor. The kitchen is hot and quickly fills with smoke.Shes cooking fava beans and bread for dinner.Living on her own, she might not have enough food. So shes staying with this family of about a dozen people to share when resources are scarce.\"I dont have a job. I dont have anyone helping me,\" she says. \"I just come here to look for help.\"Batulo makes bread in a small kitchen at the Kakuma camp. Now that her parents and siblings have left, shes staying with another family to make sure she has enough food.Batulo sleeps on a mattress with two other people, swatting away mosquitoes at night.Thorny shrubs line the maze of paths between homes in this massive camp, where about 160,000 refugees live.Calls to prayer waft through the air, which is thick with the smell of hot dust and burning trash.Houses are made of mud, tin metal sheeting or wood layered with found items like tires or -- in the case of Batulos current home -- cut and flattened tin cans.The toilet is a hole in the ground lined with corrugated tin metal sheeting.Her 24-year-old brother, Ramadhan, also lives in Kakuma and digs toilets for a living. Hes also applied for refugee resettlement in the United States. But hes waiting for immigration officials to give him the green light to travel.For now, whenever he earns anything extra, he gives Batulo money to call their parents.Batulo pleads for their help convincing authorities to let her join them. Shes heartbroken, but not hopeless.In her spare time, she pores over the two books she has left: a copy of the Quran and an English textbook called \"New Horizons.\"Wrong numberThe phone rings.Abdalla looks up. Is it Batulo?He doesnt recognize the number.At night, he has trouble sleeping, thinking that the phone might ring.When it does, his heart jumps. Could it be good news, or something unthinkable?With his daughter stuck thousands of miles away, fear rattles Abdalla whenever his cell phone rings.Whenever Batulo calls, he only talks with her briefly. He passes the phone quickly to others in the family because its too heartbreaking to hear the pain in her voice and not know how to help.But this time, the voice on the other end of the line is speaking in English, not in Somali or the Bantu language they often speak at home.\"I was calling about the Ford Explorer you listed for sale on Craigslist.\"Abdalla and his son, Juma, look at each other quizzically. They dont understand what the man is saying. They try to tell him why.\"Wrong number. Wrong number,\" Juma says.The man on the phone wont take no for an answer.\"Im calling about the Craigslist ad,\" he says in a Southern twang.Abdalla takes the phone and gives it a try.\"No English. Speak Somali,\" he repeats.The man on the other end seems puzzled, too.\"I dont speak Somali,\" he says. \"Im an American. This is America.\"On the runIn Kenya, they were known as wakimbizi.The Swahili word has come to mean refugee. But literally translated, it can also have another meaning: \"people on the run.\"For more than a decade, Abdalla and his family have been trying to stop running.After Famos death, they fled their village for the Somali capital of Mogadishu, where Abdalla says he worked in construction and his children sold charcoal for a year so they could make enough money to flee the country.Abdalla and his family leave their shoes outside their apartment in Clarkston, Georgia. Today, theyve left the door ajar to let in the breeze. But on some days when a stranger knocks, theyre still scared to open it.From there, they made their way to Kenya, trekking on foot for days until they reached their destination.Fueled by fears for their familys safety, they moved across Kenya to Kakuma in 2009.In 2012, they asked the UN for asylum, hoping an agency would help resettle them in a far-off land away from the dangers and uncertainties of life in refugee camps.It took them years of applications, screenings and interviews to make it to the United States.This was supposed to be the last stop in their search for peace.But when a stranger knocks on the door of their Clarkston apartment, they are still too scared to answer.A little escapeThe family crowds into the living room, huddling around a cell phone thats sitting atop a plug less than a foot above the floor.The tiny Samsung screen is smaller than an index card, but it still pops out against the blank white wall.After he gets a job, Abdalla hopes to save enough money to buy a TV for his family. But for now, this cell phone is one of their few escapes.Abdalla and his family dont have a TV, so they relax in their living room by watching videos on a cell phone.A dubbed Somali version of the 2007 movie \"Shoot Em Up\" is playing.The film stars Paul Giamatti and Clive Owen. The family got it about six months ago in Kenya. Theyve watched it almost every day since.Its the best movie they have, Abdalla says. In it, a drifter on the run saves an innocent child.An unanswered questionAbdalla and his family sit alone in the last row of folding chairs in an empty auditorium.Theyve arrived at the Clarkston Community Center an hour and a half early for a refugee advocacy meeting. They werent sure how long it would take to get here from their apartment, and they didnt want to be late.Theyve been waiting for more than a week to come to this meeting, ever since their English teacher told them about it in class. They hope theyll have a chance to meet with officials who can help bring their family back together.Abdalla smiles and nervously checks his phone. Hes waiting for another message from Batulo.Two days ago, his daughter called with news theyd been praying for. The International Organization for Migration scheduled a new flight for her to come to the United States. Her arrival could be days away.Batulo has lived in the Kakuma refugee camp since 2009. But until now shes never been apart from her family.But to Abdalla and Habibo, it still seems like a dream that could disappear.Before long, the room is packed with refugees searching for answers about the executive order.A local resettlement official takes the stage to share a rundown of the latest developments. Federal courts have temporarily blocked the travel ban, she says.\"Right now refugees are still arriving, and they will still arrive as long as the courts decide that the president cant stop refugee resettlement,\" Frances McBrayer of Catholic Charities of Atlanta tells them.Its been days since the judges decision. But this is the first Abdalla and Habibo have heard of it.A feeling of relief washes over Habibo. The courts have given her hope.But no one can answer her most pressing question: Is Batulo really on the way, or could another decree leave her stuck in Kenya?A younger manAbdalla holds his phone out in front of him and walks toward the window of the apartment, letting the afternoon sun hit his face.Batulo texts her family a photo to let them know shes OK.Hes using an app on his phone to video chat with Batulo, whos at a transit center in Nairobi waiting to begin her journey.Its been almost a month since the last time they talked face to face.Batulo is more than 8,000 miles away now. But this is the closest shes been in weeks.She can close her eyes and picture her life in the United States.She imagines sitting on a couch with her brothers and sisters, watching a movie.She imagines finding a job and earning enough money to help her family.She imagines the beautiful home where they will live.But looking at her cell phone screen, Batulo is shocked.

He doesnt hear them. To Abdalla, only one thing matters now. He sees his daughters face and sprints toward the light.He sweeps Batulo into his arms and carries her like a running back toward a wall on the other side of the lobby. The rest of the family follows, like a trail behind a comet as it speeds through the sky.Habibo sobs as she sits beside Batulo on the airport floor. They had feared this day would never come.Batulo is still wearing a plastic pouch around her neck, stuffed with a plane ticket and an ID card from the International Organization for Migration.\"I am a refugee from SOMALIA,\" the card says. \"I may not speak English and need help to find my next flight.\"Batulo flew more than 10,000 miles to get here, from Kakuma to Nairobi to Dubai to New York to Atlanta.

Batulo made it safely, he says.Batulos brother, Juma, pulls her suitcase as the family heads home from the Atlanta airport.Ramadhan replies that hes relieved. \"God willing,\" he says, \"someday I will make it, too.\"As they eat, Batulos family peppers her with questions.Is there a still a mango hanging from the tree outside the transit center in Nairobi?How many countries did you fly through to get here?When we left, you didnt look like this. Why are you so thin?Ibrahim brings out some of his favorite new toys. Together, they sing the ABCs. He falls asleep, curled up on the floor beside his sister.Abdalla yawns, then quickly gulps down a cup of coffee.Exhaustion is starting to set in, but this is a moment he doesnt want to miss.

Narendrans wife, Chandrika Sharma, was one of 239 people aboard MH370 Hes deeply disappointed the search for the plane was suspended He struggles to go on with life without knowing what happenedCNN —This time, the terrible news came in an email.At least it wasn’t a text, like the hasty, solitary line that exploded K.S. Narendran’s world almost three years ago: “We deeply regret that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.”His wife of 25 years, Chandrika Sharma, was one of the 239 people aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014.RELATED: Relatives of MH370 victims to appeal to Malaysian minister over searchOn Tuesday, Narendran learned the search for the missing plane had been suspended. He saw the email a little before noon at his home in the southeastern Indian city of Chennai.“An email is an improvement over an SMS message,” he posted on Facebook. “So, small mercies in an otherwise difficult period.”Courtesy K.S. Narendran K.S. Narendran is no closer to knowing what happened to his wife, a passenger on MH370.Then came the media requests for interviews. India Today, BBC, The Guardian, Deutsche Welle, NPR. He had become a spokesman for the MH370 families. After a group statement on the search suspension was made public, every journalist wanted to know Narendran’s reaction.He expressed deep disappointment that the search was over. Anger that the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia had not followed a recent recommendation to search another 25,000 square kilometers north of the last search area. And betrayal: Those governments, he said, had made a commitment to the families of the lost passengers, and now they were reneging.“I sensed my faith in the search and investigation erode precipitously, indeed faith in the entire gamut of institutional arrangements in place globally to keep us safe and secure, reassured that the journeys we undertake will indeed take us to our chosen destinations,” he wrote on Facebook.“MH370 didn’t make it to Beijing. And we may never know why it didn’t. We can never be sure that there will not be another tragedy.”The day seemed not to end. A flurry of emotions led to many moments of futility. Suspending the search was in part a message that the world was asking him to move on. As though he could.The next morning, he boarded a plane for a business trip to Mumbai on India’s west coast. After MH370, Narendran developed a dread for planes. Sometimes in his seat, he role-plays and goes to a dark place. What was the experience like for his wife?Courtesy K.S. Narendran Narendran met his wife in college and the two were married for 25 years.The question consumes him to the point where he, an articulate man with considerable language skills, finds himself at a loss for words. He has to virtually kick himself out of that state and force himself to sleep. It’s his only way out.“I don’t even wait for the plane’s doors to close,” he tells me. “I just try to sleep.”I first spoke with Narendran a few days after MH370 vanished from the skies. I reached out to him after a mutual friend showed me his Facebook posts, and we have been in touch ever since.RELATED: One man’s quiet reckoning on Flight 370This time, we talk two days after he learned of the decision to stop the search. I want to ask him many things, but first he analyzes the mystery of the missing plane. He doesn’t understand why the search was called off when debris – confirmed to be from MH370 – had been found off the coast of southern Africa.“Common sense would suggest they would be hurrying to go and look there,” he says. “It is really puzzling. I have wracked my brain all this time on why then have been such a laggard on this front.”That leaves him wondering whether there is truth to conspiracy theories that suggest a cover-up.“Maybe they know more than what was said and they want a closure to this investigation,” he says.I can hear the frustration in his voice. I can hear the exhaustion.I ask him about a difficult question a radio interviewer posed the day before: “Have you been able to have any kind of ceremony for her – funeral?”He attempted to answer: “We have had no ceremony. It’s hard to think of one when you don’t know … when was the end? Where was the end?”Narendran and I have discussed this several times in our many conversations via phone, Skype, email and even in person at a Bangalore coffee house. He said in the past that his family and friends suggested some sort of memorial to help him let go, move forward, bring closure and all those clichéd things we say after loss.RELATED: Missing plane mystery: A hole in the clouds, an empty space on earthThe truth is he doesn’t take kindly to rituals and besides, he wouldn’t even know how to begin planning such a ceremony. It would drain his energy, he tells me. And for what?How do you say goodbye to the person you loved most – without knowing?In the summer of 2015, he initiated the process of obtaining a death certificate for Chandrika. The pragmatic part of him said it was needed to settle insurance policies, bank accounts, property matters and other assets his wife held.All he really had was a message from Malaysia Airlines confirming Chandrika was a passenger on the missing plane. A death certificate would provide documentation.But it has to be issued by a court in Kuala Lumpur, and he is still waiting. One of his unsavory chores is to keep writing to ask about the status, and it adds to a host of other reminders.They include the daily walks he used to take with Chandrika. After she was gone, he often imagined conversations with the woman he met in college and had shared life’s joys and disappointments with.Where have you been, Chandrika?Oh, many places. All at the same time. Can you believe that?When will you be back?Your guess is as good as mine.For good. That is.What if I am gone for good?He fantasized about new facts being unearthed that might provide incontrovertible evidence. Then he could say: Case closed, like the ending of a Sherlock Holmes story. Time to move on.RELATED: Dear Chandrika: Conversations with my missing wifeBut those facts never came, and for almost three years now, Narendran has lived life with crushing uncertainty. There were days that were more jarring than others: when the missing plane was in the news, when debris was found, when the first anniversary came and then the second. And now, the end of the search.But to him, day 364 was the same as day 365. It was another day without her.I sense that perhaps Narendran has begun to move on, however slow the progress. I ask him if he still speaks with his wife.“My conversations lately have been with myself,” he says. “What I wish to do with my life. And I don’t think I have answers yet.”Nor has the uncertainty abated as much as he would have liked.One reason, he surmises, is his role as spokesman for Voice 370, the support group for families of the missing.“That role travels with me 24 hours a day,” he says. “It has a way of keeping alive the questions and continues the agonizing. I think the questions about finding answers, finding an explanation that is credible enough, sufficiently substantiated, remains very important.“Why? I have often asked myself the same question. And I don’t think I have a very clear answer. The sense of incredulity about all that’s happened doesn’t just go away. That something like this should ever have happened where there is neither a trace nor understanding or explanation of how this might have happened is very deeply disturbing.”Photos: Remembering the passengers of MH370 There is still no way to know for sure why Flight MH370 ended, but we are learning more about the lives of those on board.

Prev NextThen there all the relatives and friends who constantly ask him questions or want an update. “Tell me what is happening,” they say.“There is always this underlying assumption that the families know something more than the rest of the world. And we don’t,” he says.So it remains unfinished business.“I also frankly believe there are larger questions of fairness, justice, accountability that can’t be so easily put away,” he says. “There are levels of agitation and I tell myself: I can’t just let this pass. I can’t get on with life. I have not flushed my system of MH370.”These are the sorts of things Narendran is often not asked about in the myriad interviews he gives. How do you even begin in a 5-minute radio or TV segment? But I have learned about him over the course of our acquaintance.From the beginning, I felt his strength in the quietness of his voice and the power of his words. He is someone who doesn’t always emote outwardly – I’ve never heard him cry, although on several occasions he has brought tears to my eyes.He tells me that writing about MH370 and his life without Chandrika has helped him enormously. It has forced him to learn about himself.People who suffer great pain or sorrow often find refuge in prayer and hope. Many of the families of MH370 held onto the hope that everyone on that plane was still alive. That included some of Narendan’s relatives.But Narendran was not one of them. He found comfort in his writing. It helps him gain insight on how he has been dealing with life after tragedy.The eye cannot see itself, he tells me, quoting Shakespeare. “I need to hear from others on how they see me and then reflect back on what resonates with me.”We end our conversation there. What I don’t tell him is that I can see he has already done a lot of reflection; that he’s already come a long way in his recovery. The search for the missing plane may have ended Tuesday, but what continues is Narendran’s quest to find himself again.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/01/22/world/mh370-husband-speaks-out/index.html"}, {"title": "How ordinary people become 'white supremacists by default'", "data_published": "set()", "content": "CNN —Blame President Trump for his tepid moral response. Call the neo-Nazis and white nationalists thugs. Fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.But the tragedy that took place in Charlottesville this month could not have occurred without the tacit acceptance of millions of ordinary, law-abiding Americans who helped create such a racially explosive climate, some activists, historians and victims of extremism say.It’s easy to focus on the angry white men in paramilitary gear who looked like they were mobilizing for a race war in the Virginia college town. But it’s the ordinary people – the voters who elected a reality TV star with a record of making racially insensitive comments, the people who move out of the neighborhood when people of color move in, the family members who ignore a relative’s anti-Semitism – who give these type of men room to operate, they say.That was the twisted formula that made the Holocaust and Rwanda possible and allowed Jim Crow segregation to survive: Nice people looked the other way while those with an appetite for violence did the dirty work, says Mark Naison, a political activist and history professor at Fordham University in New York City.”You have to have millions of people who are willing to be bystanders, who push aside evidence of racism, Islamophobia or sexism. You can’t have one without the other,” Naison says.“We are a country with a few million passionate white supremacists – and tens of millions of white supremacists by default,” he says.Many people prefer to focus on the usual suspects after a Charlottesville happens – the violent racial extremists who are so easy to condemn. Yet there are four types of ordinary people who also play a part in the country’s racial divisions, Naison and others say:No. 1: The ‘down-low’ segregationistsMany of the white racists who marched in Charlottesville were condemned because they openly said they don’t believe in integration or racial equality.But millions of ordinary white Americans have been sending that message to black and brown people for at least a half a century.They send it with their actions: They don’t want to live next to or send their children to school with black or brown people, historians say.Busing, a nationwide campaign to end school segregation by shipping students of color to white schools, collapsed in large part because of fierce opposition by white parents. “White flight” – white families fleeing city neighborhoods after people of color moved in – helped create the modern suburbs.Boston Globe/Getty Images Think only white supremacists oppose integration? These ordinary white Boston parents protested busing in 1974.This isn’t the Jim Crow segregation that one reads about in the history books. It’s the covert or “down-low” segregationist movement that has shaped much of contemporary America since overt racism became taboo in the 1960s, says David Billings, who wrote about growing up white in the segregated South in his memoir, “Deep Denial: The Persistence of White Supremacy in United States History and Life.”“Across the country, white people withdrew from the ‘public’ sphere and migrated to ‘whites only’ suburbs to evade racial integration,” Billings wrote. “The word ‘public’ preceding words like ‘housing,’ ‘hospital,’ ‘health care,’ ‘transportation,’ ‘defender,’ ‘schools,’ and even ‘swimming pool’ in some parts of the country became code words that meant poor and most often black and Latino. The word ‘private’ began to mean ‘better.”’This white separatism continues today. Whites move out so often when nonwhites move in that sociologists have a name for the phenomenon. It’s called “racial tipping.”This separation also occurs in the private lives of many white Americans, according to one pollster. In 2013, Robert Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, made a splash after conducting a survey where he found that 75% of whites in the United States didn’t have a single person of color in their social circle – they only had white friends.Jones polled a complex subject. Many people of color self-segregate as well, and some American neighborhoods are so segregated that residents never come in contact with people of other racial or ethnic groups.We are a country with a few million passionate white supremacists – and tens of millions of white supremacists by default. Mark Naison, a political activist and history professor at Fordham UniversityYet some white Americans are driven by the same impulses that drove some of the white racists in Charlottesville – racial separation.“White people in the past century and a half have made a conscious effort to resegregate themselves,” says Edward Ball, author of “Slaves in the Family,” a memoir about coming to terms with learning his family owned slaves.“We have to work hard to make our social lives reflect our values, because white people do not choose the company of people of color generally,” he says.Ball once wrote that “unconsciously or inadvertently, all of us white folks participate in forms of supremacist thought and activity.”The angry white men in Charlottesville were just being open about their white supremacy. Ball says he wasn’t surprised by their boldness.“Their climate is now better for them,” he says.No. 2: Those who say ‘yes, but…’President Trump’s critics blasted him for not coming out strong enough against the white racists who marched in Charlottesville. Trump initially denounced the “egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.” It was the “many sides” qualifier that infuriated some people. They wanted an unequivocal denunciation of racism from a leader.Trump’s “many sides” response, though, wasn’t that abnormal in the context of US history. It used to be the norm for white political leaders to draw a moral equivalence between racists and those who suffered from their acts of brutality, historians say.It’s the “yes, but” rhetorical maneuver – condemn racism but add a qualifier to diminish the sincerity of what you just said.Archive Photos Creative/Getty Images White families fleeing people of color helped create suburban America. Its called \"white flight.\"The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ran into this “yes, but” response so much that he wrote about it in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”He wrote:“I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens’ Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace, which is the absence of tension, to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action…’”President Dwight Eisenhower took the “yes, but” approach when he complained he couldn’t move too fast to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision to integrate schools because people had to respect the Southern way of life, says Carol Anderson, author of “White Rage” and a professor of African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta.A recent Washington Post article gave other examples: When Southern governors like Orval Faubus of Arkansas and Earl Long of Louisiana were pressured in the 1950s to end segregation, they called both the NAACP and the White Citizens’ Councils, a rabid segregationist group, “extremists.”RHS/AP The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said moderate whites who refused to take a stand on racial justice angered him more than the KKK.“You get that equivocation,” says Anderson, “that trying to make a system that absolutely strips people of their humanity on par with people demanding their humanity.”That “yes, but” approach is often used today to discredit the grievances of the Black Lives Matter movement, another professor says. Whenever an unarmed black or brown person is shot by police, some deflect the issue by saying, “Yes, but all lives matter.”“When a police officer shoots an unarmed black person, even then it’s controversial to say racism is a factor,” says Erik Love, a sociologist at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. “We say, ‘Why don’t we talk about these other issues. What about the crime rate, what police officers need to protect themselves.’ And suddenly we’re not talking about race anymore.”No. 3: Those who choose chaosThere’s a famous line from the classic film, “Casablanca.” A police officer is closing down a casino, declaring, “I’m shocked – shocked – to find that gambling is going on in here!” – all while pocketing his casino winnings as they’re being handed to him on the sly.That line could apply to Trump supporters who say they’re frustrated by the President’s statements on race since Charlottesville erupted.How could you be shocked?“This is who he is, this is what he does,” says Anderson, the Emory University professor. “‘Mexicans are rapists and criminals.’ That’s what he said in his first speech. Their complicity comes in the form of self-denial instead of owning it.”For those who say they voted for Trump despite his intolerance, Anderson offers this analogy: Minister Louis Farrakhan.Farrakhan is a leader in some parts of the black community because of his message of self-help and black empowerment. He reached peak popularity in the 1990s, but he also preached anti-Semitic, anti-white, anti-Catholic and anti-homosexual rhetoric. And the organization he leads, the Nation of Islam, has taught that white people are inherently evil.Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times/Redux Fordham professor Mark Naison says America is at a scary place now where open, communal warfare could erupt.“If he was running for office and black people voted in droves for him, the narrative would be, ‘They’re supporting a racist,”’ she says.Ta-Nehisi Coates, an acclaimed writer on race relations, made a similar argument after Trump’s election in an interview with Vox’s Ezra Klein, where he responded to commentators who said not all white voters who supported Trump endorsed all of his ideas.“As my buddy said, is that what you said to the followers of Louis Farrakhan? No, nobody says that to the followers of Louis Farrakhan. No, they blasted him as an anti-Semite, which he is, and say, ‘how can people follow this bigoted message?’ That’s the ultimate testament – that you could be Donald Trump and be President. There is no black person who could have the kind of vices Donald Trump has and, hell, be governor. Maybe you could be mayor somewhere.”Many voters knew Trump would bring something else to the Oval Office – chaos. That’s why they chose him. He’s their first reality TV president, one writer says.Many voted for Trump because they liked the persona he cultivated as the star of “The Apprentice.” Reality TV rewards characters who say rude and reprehensible things, characters are often cast as racial stereotypes, and those who provoke the most chaos get the most attention, says Joy Lanzendorfer, author of the Vice article, “How Reality TV Made Donald Trump President.”“He would say horrible things about people, act out and break the rules, but people weirdly respected it,” she says. “They said he was a winner, and that’s how a winner wins.”It’s not, however, how many would want a nation’s leader to handle a racial crisis.No. 4: Those who look the other wayAri Kohen knows something about the cost of hate. When he looked at images of neo-Nazis chanting “Jews will not replace us!” in Charlottesville, he thought of his grandfather, Zalman Kohen. He was living in rural Romania in 1944 when the Nazis rounded him up with the help of his neighbors and sent him to a death camp.His grandfather survived, moved to the United States and lived until he was 90. But he never returned to Romania, says Kohen, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.This is who he is, this is what he does. ‘Mexicans are rapists and criminals.’ That’s what he said in his first speech. Their complicity comes in the form of self-denial instead of owning it. Carol Anderson, author of \"White Rage,\" on Trump voters who expressed dismay at his conduct after Charlottesville“He could never forgive his neighbors,” he says. “These were people who, maybe they didn’t love Jews, but these were people who lived next to each other. They knew his family and he knew their family. The idea that they could all stand by while life was completely and forever changed for large portions of their community – he could never understand it.”Many scholars have been vexed by the same question. When they examine genocidal events like the Holocaust, many come to the same conclusion:Never underestimate the ability of ordinary people to look away.Some do it with family members. Kohen says the hundreds of white racists who descended on Charlottesville must have family or friends who noticed their behavior beforehand. He suspects that some refused to confront them.“There’s this wink and nod, everyone knows that this person is going down a dangerous path and people passively go along with it,” he says. “They don’t want to rock the boat. This is family or a friend. It’s hard to distance yourself from people you care about.”Cliff Donaldson/Moment Editorial/Getty Images When ordinary people refuse to speak out, a country can descend into violence -- as it did in Northern Ireland.This passivity extends to how people react when their country’s leaders become intolerant, others say. Once you see it coming, you have a duty to act, says Naison, the activist and Fordham professor.“If you don’t speak up when this sort of ideology is being promoted at the highest level, you end up being complicit in the actions taken by its more extreme adherents,” Naison says. “Once the demons are unleashed, you’ve become a co-conspirator.”Naison says he doesn’t think most Americans realize how dangerous it is in their country right now. He’s warned people who voted for Trump.“I told these guys, you can’t control this; you’re playing with fire,” Naison says. “Open, violent communal warfare is scary. You can’t control it. Look at what happened in the Balkans, Northern Ireland, Israel.”There’s also evidence, though, that millions of ordinary Americans from all walks of life don’t want that kind of America. Heather Heyer, the demonstrator who lost her life in Charlottesville, was a young white woman who marched in solidarity with black protesters. Millions of Americans have since taken to the streets or social media to stand against what happened there.Former President Barack Obama even weighed in with a photo and quote that’s become the most liked tweet ever on Twitter.Obama quoted Nelson Mandela, the South African leader who knew something about hate and reconciliation. In his 1994 autobiography “Long Walk to Freedom,” Mandela wrote:“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.”Yet to get to that place Mandela talked about, it may be necessary to not just look at the usual suspects people condemn when racial violence spills into public view.If you want to know why those white racists now feel so emboldened, it may help to look at all the ordinary people around you, your neighbors, your family members, your leaders.But first, start by looking at yourself.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/ordinary-white-supremacists/index.html"}, {"title": "Get ready for a more militant and ‘woke’ NAACP", "data_published": "set()", "content": "CNN —The NAACP has described itself as the “oldest and boldest” civil rights group in America, but it may soon tack on another word to its billing: “woke.”The slang term, used to describe an unaware person who has become socially conscious, is how one national NAACP leader described the group’s recent metamorphosis. Others talked with unabashed excitement about the civil rights movement becoming “more militant” and “back to the streets.”In-your-face rhetoric is not usually associated with the venerable NAACP. The 108-year-old organization has been like the Cadillac of civil rights groups – its name still has cachet, but people prefer newer models of activism. It’s been overshadowed by Black Lives Matter and accused of being obsolete.The New York Public Library The Green Book, a pamphlet listing safe places to stay and eat for black drivers, was the black version of Triple-AAA during the Jim Crow era.But something changed when a local NAACP official recently found a way to catapult the group back into the national spotlight. He issued a travel advisory for the state of Missouri, urging “extreme CAUTION” for any person of color traveling there. The advisory evoked the Green Book, a pamphlet that guided black motorists across the treacherous terrain of Jim Crow’s America. Reporters started asking if Missouri is the new Mississippi. And NAACP leaders seemed delighted.Learn more about the storied history of the Green Book“We were built for this moment,” says John Gaskin, a spokesman for the group’s St. Louis branch. “Cadillacs are built for the highways.”Yet the story behind the story – why the NAACP came up with the advisory and what it says about a potentially seismic shift in the group’s philosophy – is as interesting as the advisory itself.Over the top or on the mark?Start with a basic question: Is the advisory really necessary, or is it a bit over the top?Consider the history. This is the first time the NAACP has issued a travel advisory.It was founded during a period of widespread lynching in the United States and didn’t issue one then.Bettmann Archive/Getty Images The NAACP is known for its civil rights work in the legal arena. But will the legacy of NAACP giants like Thurgood Marshall, in center, matter much in the era of Black Lives Matter?It didn’t issue one after four black girls were killed in a church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963.It didn’t issue one when Medgar Evers, one of its most prominent leaders, was shot to death in front of his Mississippi home that same year.It didn’t issue one when riots erupted across America after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. five years later.Why now?Nimrod “Rod” Chapel Jr., president of the NAACP’s Missouri State Conference, says he decided to issue the advisory after the state’s Legislature passed a law in June making it more difficult to sue for housing or job discrimination. The full NAACP subsequently adopted his advisory at its national convention.Chapel says the Missouri law “is worse than Jim Crow in some ways.” As justification for the advisory, he also cited a report that said black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped by officers in Missouri than white drivers.Some may say there goes a bunch of crazy kids. These are young folks who were concerned about their community, and they did something about it. That’s called activism. In the NAACP, there’s room for everybody, whether it’s Black Lives Matter or other people of conscience. Nimrod \"Rod\" Chapel Jr., president of the NAACPs Missouri State Conference, on the Black Lives Matter movement“I don’t think we could have responsibly done anything less,” Chapel says. “We have a society in Missouri that has turned its back on morality. You cannot legalize discrimination and harassment, and they’ve done that by giving immunity to people who do it.”Then there’s Missouri’s peculiar history. It’s where race riots erupted in 2014 in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson after a white police officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black youth, to death.None of that, though, is enough to merit the group’s first travel advisory, one critic says.Rick Moran, an editor with American Thinker, condemned the travel advisory in a recent column. He says it was much more dangerous driving while black in Jim Crow Mississippi than contemporary Missouri.“The whole thing is nonsense,” Moran says. “It’s a fundraising gimmick. It just seems like that’s something you do when you’re sitting around the table and someone says, ‘Gee, we’re kind of low on fundraising, what can we do to goose that number?’ “Gaskin, of the St. Louis NAACP, acknowledged that the type of racism in contemporary Missouri is not as lethal as other eras in American history. He cited the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers ambushed on a rural Mississippi road, which was depicted in the movie “Mississippi Burning.”But that doesn’t mean the travel advisory isn’t merited, he says.“Racism here in Missouri is hidden, and that can be the most devastating racism,” Gaskin says. “We’re not talking ‘Mississippi Burning’ racism. We’re talking about the sort of racism of being pulled over and asked additional questions that you might not be asked in Illinois. Folks on your street might not be so welcoming.”The advisory may have done its job. It focused national attention on the state of Missouri and brought publicity to the NAACP, which only last month had been publicly blasted by a powerful group of black ministers for verging on irrelevance.“The work of the NAACP is more important than ever before,” Gaskin says. “If it wasn’t relevant, this wouldn’t be the leading story of the last couple of days. That’s why this made the headlines – because this is the NAACP.”National Museum of American History During the era of Jim Crow, highway travel could be treacherous for black families. Many dressed up for travel but packed their own food because they werent allowed to eat at many restaurants.And at least one historian who is an authority on driving while black during those “Mississippi Burning” days wasn’t offended by the travel advisory.Calvin Ramsey wrote the play “The Green Book,” which traces the rise of the unofficial travel advisory that many blacks and Jews used during the Jim Crow era. He says he wasn’t surprised by the NAACP’s actions.Calvin Ramsey explains how travel has changed since Jim Crow era“I guess they’d rather be over the top than under the radar,” Ramsey says. “There’s a lot of raw nerves since [President Donald Trump’s] election. I thought that we had passed this in a lot of ways, but I was never totally convinced that we passed this completely.”The notoriety the NAACP’s advisory attracted is a sign of progress, he says.“We didn’t have a CNN before and people were out there on their own,” he says. “A lot of things happened that were never reported. The Green Book was our AAA guide because we couldn’t belong to AAA. It was a lifesaver.”Glimpses of a new NAACPThe travel advisory also may hint at the NAACP’s new direction.The group has gone through a rough patch. In May, it announced it would not renew the contract of its then-president, Cornell William Brooks. Its leaders called the decision part of a “transformational, systemwide refresh and strategic re-envisioning.”In June, the group held its annual national convention, where leaders talked openly about trying to remain relevant. One writer, Michael A. Fletcher of ESPN, while covering the convention said the group’s traditional approach of working within legal and legislative channels for social change can now seem “ponderous or even irrelevant” because of the “raucous” demonstrations of groups like Black Lives Matter.The whole thing is nonsense. It’s a fundraising gimmick. It just seems like that’s something you do when you’re sitting around the table and someone says, ‘Gee, we’re kind of low on fundraising, what can we do to goose that number?’ “ Rick Moran, conservative columnist on the NAACPs travel advisory for the state of MissouriAnd just weeks before the convention, a group of black ministers released a blistering open letter demanding that the NAACP change.The African Methodist Episcopal Church’s Council of Bishops called on NAACP leaders to “restructure the organization” to avoid irrelevancy. The A.M.E. Church is a pillar in the black community and has provided many of the NAACP’s best-known leaders.“Longevity alone is not proof of relevance,” the statement read. “For the reality is that today the NAACP is smaller and less influential than it has ever been in its history.”How would a new NAACP look if it answered the challenge by the A.M.E. Church?It may look a little more like Black Livers Matter.Joe Raedle/Getty Images Ferguson demonstrators during 2014 protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown. The wave of activism following Ferguson has challenged the NAACP to rethink its tactics.Traditional civil rights group have been wary and critical of Black Lives Matter activists. The movement, which gives prominent places of power to women and members of the LGBT community, is run very differently than many civil rights groups. Traditional civil rights groups evolved out of the black church, which tended to be led by autocratic men who condemned gays and lesbians and didn’t see women as equals. Even today, some black churches still won’t allow women to preach and few officially affirm gay and lesbians.Some of that wariness also may be rooted in generational differences. There have often been clashes between older civil rights leaders and the young folks they condemned for moving too fast and being too aggressive. Andrew Young, a close aide to King, once apologized after calling Black Lives Matter activists “unlovable little brats.”Now, however, at least some NAACP leaders are talking about Black Lives Matter activists as potential allies, not rivals.Chapel, the Missouri NAACP official who issued the travel advisory, says he admires Black Lives Matter.“Some may say there goes a bunch of crazy kids,” he says. “These are young folks who were concerned about their community, and they did something about it. That’s called activism. In the NAACP, there’s room for everybody, whether it’s Black Lives Matter or other people of conscience.”The NAACP has lasted a long time for a reason. There’s a risk when you copy the latest flavor. You risk losing your core constituency. Shayne Lee, University of Houston sociologistAnthony Davis, national coordinator for the college and youth division of the NAACP, is a fan as well.“I love it,” he says. “As a result of the Black Lives Matter movement, the social justice and civil rights movement has been able to become more militant. It’s OK to be back in the streets. We would love to partner and work with Black Lives Matter because we appreciate them for what they do.”Davis says the NAACP is already adjusting its outreach to younger people. He says it’s creating more engaging platforms on social media to attract youth and touring with hip-hop stars to register voters for the 2018 midterms.“Over the last year, we’ve done a good job branding ourselves as not only this historic civil rights group, but the youth and college division is more hip and, I hate to use this term, but, ‘woke,’ ” Davis says.Becoming more like Black Lives Matter, though, might not be good for the NAACP, one sociologist says. He says the group lacks structure and long-term vision. The Black Lives Matter movement has also been weakened by infighting.Learn about divisions within the Black Lives Matter Movement“The NAACP has lasted a long time for a reason,” says Shayne Lee, a sociologist with the University of Houston. “There’s a risk when you copy the latest flavor. You risk losing your core constituency.”The Missouri travel advisory may mark a new direction for the NAACP, but the kind of leader the group chooses next may serve as the ultimate proof of a new “woke” NAACP.Gaskin, the St. Louis NAACP leader, sounds confident.Some in the black community, he says, were asleep during the last eight years while Barack Obama was President. Now they’re in the Trump era, and they’re taking a second look at the NAACP.“At that time, they didn’t think they needed us,” he says. “You don’t miss water until your well dries.”The next few months and years will show if the group can not only be “bold,” “old” and “woke,” but do something else:Adapt.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/08/10/us/naacp-remade-travel-advisory/index.html"}, {"title": "When exorcists need help, they call him", "data_published": "2017-08-04T04:23:24Z", "content": "(CNN) A small group of nuns and priests met the woman in the chapel of a house one June evening. Though it was warm outside, a palpable chill settled over the room.As the priests began to pray, the woman slipped into a trance -- and then snapped to life. She spoke in multiple voices: One was deep, guttural and masculine; another was high-pitched; a third spouted only Latin. When someone secretly sprinkled ordinary water on her, she didnt react. But when holy water was used, she screamed in pain.\"Leave her alone, you f***ing priests,\" the guttural voice shouted. \"Stop, you whores. ... Youll be sorry.\"Youve probably seen this before: a soul corrupted by Satan, a priest waving a crucifix at a snarling woman. Movies and books have mimicked exorcisms so often, theyve become clichés.The 1973 film \"The Exorcist\" shaped how many see demonic possession.But this was an actual exorcism -- and included a character not normally seen in the traditional drive-out-the-devil script.Dr. Richard Gallagher is an Ivy League-educated, board-certified psychiatrist who teaches at Columbia University and New York Medical College. He was part of the team that tried to help the woman.Fighting Satans minions wasnt part of Gallaghers career plan while he was studying medicine at Yale. He knew about biblical accounts of demonic possession but thought they were an ancient cultures attempt to grapple with mental disorders like epilepsy. He proudly calls himself a \"man of science.\"Yet today, Gallagher has become something else: the go-to guy for a sprawling network of exorcists in the United States. He says demonic possession is real. Hes seen the evidence: victims suddenly speaking perfect Latin; sacred objects flying off shelves; people displaying \"hidden knowledge\" or secrets about people that they could not have possibly have known.\"There was one woman who was like 90 pounds soaking wet. She threw a Lutheran deacon who was about 200 pounds across the room,\" he says. \"Thats not psychiatry. Thats beyond psychiatry.\"Gallagher calls himself a \"consultant\" on demonic possessions. For the past 25 years, he has helped clergy distinguish between mental illness and what he calls \"the real thing.\" He estimates that hes seen more cases of possession than any other physician in the world.There was one woman who was like 90 pounds soaking wet. She threw a Lutheran deacon who was about 200 pounds across the room. Thats not psychiatry. Thats beyond psychiatry. Dr. Richard Gallagher, psychiatrist, professor and demonic possession \"consultant\"\"Whenever I need help, I call on him,\" says the Rev. Gary Thomas, one of the most famous exorcists in the United States. The movie \"The Rite\" was based on Thomas work.\"Hes so respected in the field,\" Thomas says. \"Hes not like most therapists, who are either atheists or agnostics.\"Gallagher is a big man -- 6-foot-5 -- who once played semipro basketball in Europe. He has a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor. When he talks about possession, it sounds as if hes describing the growth of algae; his tone is dry, clinical, matter-of-fact.Possession, he says, is rare -- but real.\"I spend more time convincing people that theyre not possessed than they are,\" he wrote in an essay for The Washington Post.Some critics, though, say Gallagher has become possessed by his own delusions. They say all hes witnessed are cheap parlor tricks by people who might need therapy but certainly not exorcism. And, they argue, theres no empirical evidence that proves possession is real.Still, one of the biggest mysteries about Gallaghers work isnt what hes seen. Its how hes evolved.How does a \"man of science\" get pulled into the world of demonic possession?His short answer: He met a queen of Satan.A creepy encounter with evilShe was a middle-age woman who wore flowing dark clothes and black eye shadow. She could be charming and engaging. She was also part of a satanic cult.She called herself the queen of the cult, but Gallagher would refer to her as \"Julia,\" the pseudonym he gave her.The woman had approached her local priest, convinced she was being attacked by a demon. The priest referred her to an exorcist, who reached out to Gallagher for a mental health evaluation.Why, though, would a devil worshipper want to be free of the devil?\"She was conflicted,\" Gallagher says. \"There was a part of her that wanted to be relieved of the possession.\"She ended up relieving Gallagher of his doubts. It was one of the first cases he took, and it changed him. Gallagher helped assemble an exorcism team that met Julia in the chapel of a house.Objects would fly off shelves around her. She somehow knew personal details about Gallaghers life: how his mother had died of ovarian cancer; the fact that two cats in his house went berserk fighting each other the night before one of her sessions.Julia found a way to reach him even when she wasnt with him, he says.He was talking on the phone with Julias priest one night, he says, when both men heard one of the demonic voices that came from Julia during her trances -- even though she was nowhere near a phone and thousands of miles away.He says he was never afraid.\"Its creepy,\" he says. \"But I believe Im on the winning side.\"How a scientist believes in demonsHe also insists that hes on the side of science.He says hes a stickler for the scientific method, that it teaches people to follow the facts wherever they may lead.Growing up in a large Irish Catholic family in Long Island, he didnt think much about stories of possession. But when he kept seeing cases like Julias as a professional, he says, his views had to evolve.Some priests say those who dabble in the occult are opening doorways to the demonic.\"I dont believe in this stuff because Im Catholic,\" he says. \"I try to follow the evidence.\"Being Catholic, though, may help.Gallagher grew up in a home where faith was taken seriously. His younger brother, Mark, says Gallagher was an academic prodigy with a photographic memory who wanted to use his faith to help people.\"We had a sensational childhood,\" Mark Gallagher says. \"My mother and father were great about always helping neighbors or relatives out.\" Their mother was a homemaker, and their father was a lawyer whod fought in World War II. \"My father used to walk us proudly into church. He taught us to give back.\"Gallaghers two ways of giving back -- helping the mentally ill as well as the possessed -- may seem at odds. But not necessarily for those in the Catholic Church.Contemporary Catholicism doesnt see faith and science as contradictory. Its leaders insist that possession, miracles and angels exist. But global warming is real, so is evolution, and miracles must be documented with scientific rigor.More from The Other Side Some stories blur the lines between science, spirituality and the supernatural. These stories are from \"The Other Side.\" Where do coincidences come from?Synchronicity is familiar to many people, yet few understand how it works. Are our lives are shaped by unseen hands? Or are we victims of psychological narcissm? Beyond GoodbyeSome people not only share their life but their moment of death with loved ones. Are these \"shared-death experiences\" real or a mirage? Why Bigfoot is getting nervousMonster stories have been around for millennia. Now hunters are hot on the trail, armed with cameras, drones and night-vision goggles. Can they catch one? Ghost hunters haunted by competitionWeve heard of ghosts that harass the living. Now people are starting to harass the ghosts. Across America, teams are creeping through peoples homes, trying to get rid of their paranormal pests. Heaven popular, except with the churchPopular culture is filled with accounts from people who claim to have near-death experiences. So why doesnt the church talk about heaven anymore? Bidding farewell from beyond the grave?Although visits by the spirits of the recently departed can be chilling, they are also comforting, say those whove seen these \"crisis apparitions.\" Can bonds between loved ones defy death?One of Gallaghers favorite sources of inspiration is Pope John Paul IIs encyclical \"Fides et Ratio\" (\"On Faith and Reason\"). The Pope writes that \"there can never be a true divergence between faith and reason, since the same God who reveals the mysteries and bestows the gift of faith has also placed in the human spirit the light of reason.\"The churchs emphasis on faith and reason can even been seen in the birth of its exorcism ritual.The Rite of Exorcism was first published in 1614 by Pope Paul V to quell a trend of laypeople and priests hastily performing exorcisms on people they presumed were possessed, such as victims of the bubonic plague, says the Rev. Mike Driscoll, author of \"Demons, Deliverance, Discernment: Separating Fact from Fiction about the Spirit World.\"\"A line (in the rite) said that the exorcist should be careful to distinguish between demon possession and melancholy, which was a catchall for mental illness,\" Driscoll says. \"The church knew back then that there were mental problems. It said the exorcist should not have anything to do with medicine. Leave that to the doctors.\"Doctors, perhaps, like Gallagher.Gallagher says the concept of possession by spirit isnt limited to Catholicism. Muslim, Jewish and other Christian traditions regard possession by spirits -- holy or benign -- as possible.\"This is not quite as esoteric as some people make it out to be,\" Gallagher says. \"I know quite a few psychiatrists and mental health professionals who believe in this stuff.\"Dr. Mark Albanese is among them. A friend of Gallaghers, Albanese studied medicine at Cornell and has been practicing psychiatry for decades. In a letter to the New Oxford Review, a Catholic magazine, he defended Gallaghers belief in possession.He also says there is a growing belief among health professionals that a patients spiritual dimension should be accounted for in treatment, whether their provider agrees with those beliefs or not. Some psychiatrists have even talked of adding a \"trance and possession disorder\" diagnosis to the DSM, the premier diagnostic manual of disorders used by mental health professionals in the US.Theres still so much about the human mind that psychiatrists dont know, Albanese says. Doctors used to be widely skeptical of people who claimed to suffer from multiple personalities, but now its a legitimate disorder (dissociative identity disorder). Many are still dumbfounded by the power of placebos, a harmless pill or medical procedure that produces healing in some cases.\"Theres a certain openness to experiences that are happening that are beyond what we can explain by MRI scans, neurobiology or even psychological theories,\" Albanese says.Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, a psychiatrist who specializes in schizophrenia, arrived at a similar conclusion after he had an unnerving experience with a patient.Lieberman was asked to examine the videotape of an exorcism that he subsequently dismissed as unconvincing.Then he met a woman who, he said, \"freaked me out.\"Lieberman, director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, says he and a family therapist were asked to examine a young woman who some thought was possessed. He and his colleague tried to treat the woman for several months but gave up because they had no success.The film \"The Rite\" is based on the life of the Rev. Gary Thomas, one of the leading exorcists in the US.Something happened during the treatment, though, that he still cant explain. After sessions with the woman, he says, hed go home in the evenings, and the lights in his house would go off by themselves, photographs and artwork would fall or slide off shelves, and hed experience a piercing headache.When he mentioned to this to his colleague one day, her response stunned him: Shed been having the exact same experiences.\"I had to sort of admit that I didnt really know what was going on,\" Lieberman says. \"Because of the bizarre things that occurred, I wouldnt say that (demonic possession) is impossible or categorically rule it out ... although I have very limited empirical evidence to verify its existence.\"The tragic case of the real Emily RoseIf you want to know why so many scientists and doctors like Lieberman are cautious about legitimizing demonic possession, consider one name: Anneliese Michel.Michel was a victim in one of the most notorious cases of contemporary exorcism. If you have the stomach for it, go online and listen to audiotapes and watch videos of her exorcisms. The images and sounds will burn themselves into your brain. It sounds like somebody dropped a microphone into hell.Michel was a German Catholic woman who died of starvation in 1976 after 67 exorcisms over a period of nine months. She was diagnosed with epilepsy but believed she was possessed. So did her devout Roman Catholic parents. She reportedly displayed some of the classic signs of possession: abnormal strength, aversion to sacred objects, speaking different languages.But authorities later determined that it was Michels parents and two priests who were responsible for her death. German authorities put them on trial for murder, and they were found guilty of negligent homicide. The 2005 film \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" was based on Michels ordeal and the subsequent trial.The worst thing you can do to a patient who is delusional is to confirm their delusions. Telling a patient who is struggling that maybe theyre possessed by a demon is the worst thing you can do. Steven Novella, a neurologist and professor at Yale School of MedicineOne of the leading skeptics of exorcism -- and one of Gallaghers chief critics -- is Steven Novella, a neurologist and professor at Yale School of Medicine.He wrote a lengthy blog post dissecting Gallaghers experience with Julia, the satanic priestess. It could be read as a takedown of exorcisms everywhere.He says Julia probably performed a \"cold reading\" on Gallagher. Its an old trick of fortune tellers and mediums in which they use vague, probing statements to make canny guesses about someone. (Fortune teller: \"I see a recent tragedy in your family.\" Client: \"You mean my sister who got hurt in a car accident? How did you know?\")Or take the case of a person speaking an unfamiliar language like Latin during a possession.\"A patient might memorize Latin phrases to throw out during one of their possessions,\" Novella wrote. \"Were they having a conversation in Latin? Did they understand Latin spoken to them? Or did they just speak Latin?\"Novella says its noteworthy that no one has filmed any paranormal event such as levitation or sacred objects flying across the room during an exorcism. Hes seen exorcism tapes posted online and in documentaries and says theyre not scary.\"Theyre boring,\" he says. \"Nothing exciting happens. The most you get is some really bad play-acting by the person who is being exorcised.\"In an interview, Novella went further and criticized any therapist who believes his patients delusions.\"The worst thing you can do to a patient who is delusional is to confirm their delusions,\" says Novella, who founded the New England Skeptical Society.\"The primary goal of therapy is to reorient them to reality. Telling a patient who is struggling that maybe theyre possessed by a demon is the worst thing you can do. Its only distracting them from addressing what the real problem is.\"The 2005 horror film \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" was loosely based on the death of Anneliese Michel.Driscoll, the Catholic priest who wrote a book about possession, is not a skeptic like Novella. Still, he says, its not unusual for people on drugs or during psychotic episodes to display abnormal strength.\"I have seen it take four grown guys to hold one small woman down,\" says Driscoll, a chaplain at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Ottawa, Illinois. \"When a person has no fear and is not in their right mind and they dont care about hurting themselves or hurting others, you can see heartbreaking things.\"That doesnt mean he thinks possession isnt real. He says the New Testament is full of accounts of Jesus confronting demons.\"Do I still believe it happens? Yes, I do,\" he says. \"It happened then. I dont know why it would be totally eradicated now.\"Gallagher agrees and has answers for skeptics like Novella.He says demons wont submit to lab studies or allow themselves to be easily recorded by video equipment. They want to sow doubt, not confirm their existence, he says. Nor will the church compromise the privacy of a person suffering from possession just to provide film to skeptics.Gallagher says he sees his work with the possessed as an extension of his responsibilities as a doctor.In a passage from a book he is working on about demonic possession in America, he says that it is the duty of a physician to help people in great distress \"without concern whether they have debatable or controversial conditions.\"Gallagher isnt the first psychiatrist to feel such duty. Dr. M. Scott Peck, the late author of \"The Road Less Traveled,\" conducted two exorcisms himself -- something Gallagher considers unwise and dangerous for any psychiatrist.\"I didnt go volunteering for this,\" he says. \"I went into this because different people over the last few decades realized that I was open to this sort of thing. The referrals are almost invariably from priests. Its not like someone is walking into my office and I say, You must be possessed. \"What happened to Satans queenHe may not have asked to join the \"hidden\" world of exorcism, but he is an integral part of that community today. Hes been featured in stories and documentaries about exorcism and is on the governing board of the Rome-based International Association of Exorcists.\"Its deepened my faith,\" he says of the exorcisms hes witnessed. \"It didnt radically change it, but it validated my faith.\"He says hes received thanks from many people hes helped over the years. Some wept, grateful to him for not dismissing them as delusional. As for letting a journalist talk to any of these people, Gallagher says he zealously guards their privacy.Belief in possession exists in many religious traditions. Here, a man enters a state of possession during an African voodoo ceremony.Julia, though, gave him permission to tell her story. But it didnt have a happy ending.He and a team of exorcists continued to see her, but eventually, she called a halt to the sessions. She was too ambivalent. She relished some of the abilities she displayed during her trances. She was \"playing both sides.\"\"Exorcism is not some kind of magical incantation,\" Gallagher says. \"Normally, a person has to make their own sincere spiritual efforts, too.\"About a year after she dropped out, Gallagher says, he heard Julias voice on the phone again. This time, she had called to tell him she was dying of cancer.Gallagher says he offered to try to help her with a team of priests while she was still physically able, but her response was terse:\"Well, Ill give it some thought.\"He says he never heard from her again.Inevitably, there will be others. His phone will ring. A priest will tell him a story. A team of clergy and nuns will be summoned. And the man of science will enter the hidden world of exorcism again.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.The critics, the souls that arent saved, the creepy encounters -- they dont seem to deter him.\"Truly informed exorcists dont tend to get discouraged,\" he says, \"because they know it is our Lord who delivers the person, not themselves.\"Is Gallagher doing Gods work, or does he need deliverance from his own delusions?Perhaps only God -- and Satan -- knows for sure.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/08/04/health/exorcism-doctor/index.html"}, {"title": "'Folks don't feel safe'", "data_published": "2017-04-30T20:11:39Z", "content": "Winston-Salem, North Carolina (CNN) The protesters chant in English, then in Spanish, as they belt out their rallying cry.\"The people, united, will never be defeated!\"\"El pueblo, unido, jamás será vencido!\"Winston-Salems leaders are hours away from deciding whether to declare this a \"welcoming city\" for immigrants.

The 25-year-olds mission: using her voice for those who have none.She has a green card, but most of her friends and family dont. And as she stands on the steps of City Hall tonight, she knows shes carrying the weight of thousands of people who need help, but arent here simply because theyre too scared to show up.The neighbors who panicked when they saw a white van circling their apartment complex, terrified that ICE agents were about to swoop in. The children at her church who went running when police neared their playground. The friend who just asked her to take care of her kids if she gets deported.The counter-protester winds her way into the building. A demonstrator waving a sign saying \"HUMAN RIGHTS\" follows close behind.The crowd resumes chanting, louder than before.A proposed resolution declaring Winston-Salem a \"welcoming city\" brought a contentious debate to City Hall and drew sharp criticism from state lawmakers.From inside, Joan Fleming can hear them. And its making her uneasy.She thinks back to riots she lived through as a child growing up in the 1960s. Her father was a police officer then. She thought of him as she came to City Hall today, carrying an American flag tote bag stuffed with petitions. He raised her to respect the importance of law and order.Back then, when violence flared during protests, shed wait by the door of her familys home in Kinston, North Carolina. Every night she feared her father wouldnt make it back alive.Now as she sits inside the City Councils meeting room, those fears have been replaced by new ones -- growing concerns about what Fleming believes could be just around the corner, and what she feels is lurking in plain sight.Shes already warned the City Council about what she fears will happen if they pass the \"welcoming city\" proposal: Felons will flock to Winston-Salem.\"There are thousands of chances per month for you or your loved one to be killed by a suspected illegal drunk driver,\" she told officials at last months meeting.Tonight she hopes theyll remember what she said.Echoes of a larger fightThis was the scene on Monday, April 17, in one corner of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as a controversial vote loomed.But it could be anywhere in America in 2017, as increasingly divisive debates over immigration expose feelings simmering beneath the surface.President Donald Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a focal point of his administration.He took steps to retaliate against so-called sanctuary cities, vowing to cut off funding to local governments that dont cooperate with the feds. He doubled down on his message that undocumented immigrants can be a danger to communities, creating an office focused on victims of immigrant crimeCritics say Trump is highlighting crime as a pretext for plans to kick out as many undocumented immigrants as possible, regardless of whether they pose a threat.Its too soon to say whether these early numbers will translate into a trend.But spend a day in this Southern city, where the salvos of national political battles echo loudly, and youll see signs of a deepening shift beyond whats measured with statistics in spreadsheets.Tensions are high. So are suspicions. And theres one thing both sides have in common: fear.Sending a messageAt first, Dan Besse thought his resolution declaring Winston-Salem a welcoming city would sail to approval.The city already prides itself on being a place thats made immigrants feel at home. Industrial, manufacturing and construction jobs, plus a low cost of living, made Winston-Salem an attractive destination.Besse is an attorney whos been on Winston-Salems City Council since 2001. He thought his proposal wouldnt rock the boat much because it wasnt creating new rules or overturning any old ones. But hed heard about mounting fears for immigrants in his city -- about parents who were too scared to take their children to doctors appointments or leave them in after-school programs, about threats to local mosques.And he wanted to send a symbolic message.\"A lot of folks dont feel safe,\" he said, \"and they really need this kind of reassurance that their local elected representatives are on their side.\"Dan Besse, a Democrat on Winston-Salems City Council, saw his \"welcoming city\" resolution as a palatable compromise. Instead, it became a flashpoint for the national immigration debate.So at a February meeting, Besse unveiled a resolution that he says intended to do just that. It was a compromise move that skirted the word \"sanctuary\" and some of the more controversial measures activists had proposed, such as a pledge to limit cooperation with federal law enforcement.Among its proclamations: \"Whereas, the current national environment of excessive fear and suspicion directed by some toward immigrants, refugees, and other newcomers calls for cities like Winston-Salem to reaffirm our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all.\"In this left-leaning city with a City Council where seven of the eight members are Democrats, it was the kind of message that sounded like an easy sell.Maybe a few years ago, or even a few months ago, it would have been.Besses proposal cleared a committee and seemed to be gaining steam among his colleagues. But it wasnt long before it sparked an uproar. First local Republicans rallied against it. Then state elected officials took aim.At a meeting in Raleigh, they told Winston-Salem to bury the welcoming city measure or risk losing funding.\"There will be consequences if Winston-Salem does this,\" one state senator warnedLike a rattlesnakeAs she gets ready for the vote, Joan Fleming sits at her kitchen table, staring at her laptop screen.A wood carving of the continental United States hangs behind her, near metal sculpted into cursive lettering that says \"Faith\" and \"Love.\"A magnet on her refrigerator says, \"Friends dont let friends vote Democrat.\"The lifelong Republican is no stranger to rallying around a cause.

Its someone she hopes will be at tonights meeting. And she wants to make sure theyve signed her petition.\"Ive put it on my Facebook about 2,500 times. If you havent seen it, you must be living under a rock,\" she says. \"I dont know how to put it out there any other way.\"Joan Fleming says she cant understand why anyone would want to label Winston-Salem a welcoming city. \"I wonder their real reason for why they want to bring felons into our city and say its the right thing to do,\" she says.Beside her, she has copies of several recent arrest reports -- proof, she says, that being too lax about illegal immigration is endangering people in the area.Is it unfair to paint an entire group based on the most severe crimes committed by a handful of people? Fleming doesnt think so. She suspects the amount of crime connected to illegal immigration is under-reported. And even one crime, she feels, is one crime too many.\"Its a life. Its a rape,\" she says. \"If we hadnt been negligent in letting them in here, it wouldnt have happened.\"She resents it when critics call her and others who oppose Winston-Salems proposed welcoming city measure hateful or racist. Fleming says theres nothing hateful about supporting legal immigration and standing firmly against illegal immigration.\"I might like a rattlesnake,\" she says, \"but I dont want them in my living room. I lock my doors at night.\"If she were a few years younger, Fleming, whos in her 60s, says shed head to the Mexican border and build the wall herself.Collecting ammunitionInstead, Fleming is spending Monday afternoon on the road, driving around Winston-Salems suburbs as she picks up copies of petitions. The vote is only a few hours away, and she knows every signature counts.She heads down a hilly country road, past grazing horses and Baptist churches and an apartment complex called Plantation Place, to collect a stack of papers left for her. The petitions are on top of a Buick parked in a carport with a \"Make America Great Again\" bumper sticker.She stops in a Chick-fil-A parking lot near a strip mall to get another stack from a friend whos fallen ill and wont be able to make it to tonights meeting.Fleming doesnt live inside the city limits. Her home is about a 20-minute drive away, near a golf course in Advance, North Carolina. But most of her family lives in the city. And Fleming says anything that happens inside Winston-Salem will spread.Flemings lived outside Winston-Salem for several years in suburban Advance, North Carolina. But she fears decisions the city makes will affect residents all over the region. \"What about the Americans?\" she says. \"Whos protecting us?\"Shes heading to City Hall armed with a tote bag full of testimonials from others who share her views:\"I will no longer feel safe as a single female if this happens.\"\"The safety of our city and our children is at stake.\"\"Our city is being overrun with aliens. I notice my own neighborhood is being flooded with immigrants. ... I dont feel safe letting my grandchildren play outside unless I am with them. Not the America my children grew up in.\"Loud and clearAs they chant on the steps outside City Hall, the protesters are sending a very different message:\"No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all.\"\"Fund educations, not deportations.\"\"Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here.\"\"Hey yall,\" Valeria Rodriguez Cobos says into the microphone, smiling at the crowd.Rodriguez Cobos was only a year and a half old when her parents brought her to the United States from their home in Oaxaca, Mexico. For 22 years, she was undocumented. Like many of her family members, she lived in the shadows, terrified that the life she was trying to build could dissolve in an instant.But the 25-year-old is a permanent resident now. Several years ago she was able to petition for legal residency under the Violence Against Women Act after surviving an abusive relationship.Today shes wearing a black T-shirt with bold white letters on it that say, \"free.\"Legal immigration status has brought some stability, but she says its impossible to feel secure when almost everyone you know is still at risk.Valeria Rodriguez Cobos says shes trying to use her voice to help people who are too scared to speak out. \"Deportations are happening,\" she says. \"People here in Winston dont talk about that. Theyre afraid.\"Rodriguez Cobos chokes up as she tells the crowd how privileged she feels to have a green card.\"Its something I know my family still doesnt have,\" she says. \"So for me, the fight is not over until were all safe.\"A woman who works with refugees describes the harrowing stories theyve told her about what happened before they fled their homes. A Wake Forest law professor explains that theres nothing illegal about the resolution the City Council is finally about to vote on. Besse tells the crowd that whatever happens to his resolution tonight doesnt really matter.The important thing, he says, is continuing community activism, standing up for whats right and not letting lawmakers in Raleigh dictate the way the city handles its affairs.\"We cannot afford to capitulate to bullying tactics and intimidation, telling us not to speak up and out on behalf of those who are marginalized in our communities.\"Pointing toward homeLori Apple watches from a few feet away, wearing a sparkling American flag lapel pin on her jean jacket. The protesters words quickly get under the 60-year-old physical therapists skin.They seem to be fanning the flames of emotions, she says, rather than relying on facts.Apple, the head of a local Republican womens association, says the welcoming city resolution quickly drew fire from many people in her party.Its clear, she says, that the measure is a thinly veiled attempt to turn Winston-Salem into a sanctuary city. Thats extremely unwise, she says, given vows by Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to yank federal funding from local jurisdictions that dont cooperate with immigration enforcement efforts.And its not just federal officials who are threatening to fight back against local measures, she says.State lawmakers in North Carolina outlawed sanctuary cities back in 2015. Then-Gov. Pat McCrory signed the measure in nearby Greensboro. And now, legislators in Raleigh are weighing ways to punish local governments that take sanctuary steps.But Apple says the concerns she and others share arent just about the millions of dollars Winston-Salem could stand to lose.She says shes worried about her family -- about the spots they could lose in college, about extra time they could be stuck waiting in emergency rooms, about the ways crime could go up and terrorists could slip in.\"I have children and I am concerned with the safety of our community,\" she says. \"The loud voices of a few drown out the quiet voices of good, hard-working Americans who are not in favor of these kinds of measures.\"Lori Apple says the US should approach immigration the way she handles her home. \"It makes sense to have a wall,\" she says, \"because I have a door protecting my house.\"To sum up her views on immigration, Apple uses her three-bedroom house in Lewisville, about 15 minutes outside Winston-Salem, as a metaphor.There are only so many items in the refrigerator to go around and only so many rooms in the house where theres space to live, she says. And of course, she keeps the doors locked at night and takes other steps, she says, to protect against intruders.Resources are scarce in America, Apple says. And the country needs to do what it can to keep out terrorists and keep its citizens safe.Thats all the president and North Carolinas state lawmakers are trying to do, she says.\"Theres a lot of anger among people towards Trump,\" she says. \"But hes trying to protect us.\"I show them safetyAcross town, Carmen is just winding down her day cleaning houses.The 43-year-old undocumented immigrant cant make it to tonights meeting. But shes been following news of the proposed \"welcoming city\" measure closely. And shes hoping the city will pass it.\"It would be a safer city,\" she says. \"It would be a relief for us.\"Carmen, who asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her familys safety, has trouble feeling safe these days.Shes terrified that Trump will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting her three children in jeopardy.Shes afraid jobs for immigrant workers are going to dry up.Shes scared to go out at night.She senses people are giving her hostile glances in stores.Carmen, a 43-year-old undocumented immigrant, turns to her faith as times get tough. These days, she finds herself spending more time inside her Winston-Salem home. Shes scared to be out late at night or go to parks with her family.It wasnt like this before, Carmen says. Trump, she says, has planted seeds of hatred across the country. But Carmen says shes seen love blossoming, too. One day people from a nearby church left signs outside for her churchs largely immigrant congregation.\"Somos uno en Cristo.\" We are one in Christ.\"Dios te ama.\" God loves you.\"Nos encantan nuestros vecinos.\" We love our neighbors.Carmen was overjoyed. She snapped photos of her children with the signs and keeps them on her phone.Shes afraid of what will happen next, but she doesnt talk about it with her children.\"I show another face to them. I show them safety,\" she says. \"I dont show them the fear I feel.\"A tense waitInside City Hall, Fleming is one of the first people to arrive in the City Councils meeting room.Its already tense. There arent enough chairs. Some people whisper. Others glare suspiciously across the room.Fleming settles on a spot in the middle of the third row, then moves to the other side of the room after a man snarls at her for trying to save a seat.Rodriguez Cobos sits with a few friends on the floor of a room upstairs, their eyes trained on a TV screen.So many people have shown up to tonights meeting that officials opened two overflow rooms to give them a chance to follow whats happening.Rodriguez Cobos friends are US citizens whose parents are undocumented immigrants, and theyre here to make their voices heard. But as they sit inside the imposing government building, Valeria can see that her friends are spooked.She tries to explain what she knows about city government to them. In between her business administration classes at Salem College and her work at a local credit union, shes been coming here regularly for months. The pomp and circumstance of a local government meeting is familiar now. The way the clerk reads out the name of each resolution. The way the council members make motions.She wants her friends to feel like they belong here. This is their city, too, even though sometimes it may not feel like it.As tonights vote nears, they lean in toward the TV to listen.Caught off guardTheres no fanfare as the clerk announces whats next on the agenda: \"Item G-4, Adoption of the Winston-Salem is a Welcoming City Resolution.\" This is the moment almost everyone in the building is waiting for.But the mayor makes a surprise announcement that catches many of them off guard.Besse, he says, has asked to withdraw the resolution from the nights agenda.\"Hes working on an alternative thought,\" the mayor tells the crowd.Rodriguez Cobos and her friends cant believe what theyre hearing. She wants to run screaming into the meeting room. How can this be happening?Fleming feels frustrated too. Her rush to get signatures for a petition, her push to save seats inside for fellow Republicans who feel the same way she does -- all of it seems like a waste of time.A man rushes to the front of the room, yelling as he heads out the door: \"Boo! Cowards!\"In the public comment period that ends the meeting, speaker after speaker slams the City Council for letting worries about retribution from state and federal officials stop them from taking a stand.\"What we heard today,\" one woman says, \"was fear.\"One man says the move sets a dangerous precedent. \"If you allow them to bully you all, then who will they come for next?\"Another says hes tired of hearing people focus on crimes committed by immigrants.\"Theres people who look like me who ran people over. Theres people who shot up schools who look like me. Should we deport all of them, too? Are we just going to use fear as our guiding principle?\"Rodriguez Cobos is the last person to speak. She says she and others wont forget how the City Council backed down instead of standing up.\"Elections are coming up,\" she says, \"and people are paying attention.\"Its no coincidence that state lawmakers in Raleigh have tried to block the resolution, says Danny Timpona, who supports the measure. \"Theyre scared of us coming together,\" he says. \"Theyre scared were paying attention.\"As Rodriguez Cobos walks to her car after the meeting, she looks over her shoulder.Shes determined to keep speaking out, but she knows it makes her a target.Fleming walks quickly to her car, too.She fears crime is on the rise. And you never know who might be watching.The next battleBut Besse maintains his proposal isnt dead. Instead, he says hes planning to bring it back in a different form. Pulling it from the agenda was a change in tactics, he says, but not a retreat.When he realized the welcoming city resolution wouldnt have enough support to pass, Besse says he withdrew the measure to avoid sending the wrong signal.These days, hes carrying a copy of a new document inside his jacket pocket as he walks around Winston-Salem. Hes hoping to convince leaders from across the community to sign on.A joint statement from a broader group touting the citys welcoming nature, he says, will send a stronger message than any City Council resolution would.Rodriguez Cobos and other organizers with the Sanctuary City Coalition of Winston-Salem say their fight has only just begun. Theyll be marching in an upcoming \"day without immigrants\" protest.And theyre hoping to take more concrete steps to help protect an immigrant community under siege. One idea: emergency response teams that can report to areas where ICE arrests are taking place.Fleming picked up a \"Make America Great Again\" sign on a recent trip. Shes thrilled Trump won and glad hes made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority. \"If I werent as old as I am,\" she says, \"I would go build that wall.\"Fleming says shes keeping a close eye on the City Council in case the welcoming city measure comes up again.And shes going to keep canvasing for signatures on her petition opposing it.Shes also working on promoting the local Republican womens clubs next activity: a self-defense class.A family crisisAt a church Bible study meeting in northern Winston-Salem, Carmen is looking for answers.The City Council meeting was a few days ago. Shes still hoping officials will change their mind, and she wishes shed been at City Hall to see what happened. She went once and loved the part where everyone stood together to say the Pledge of Allegiance.But this week, shes barely had any time to spare. Shes overwhelmed with a crisis thats shaken her family.Her brother is in a detention center and could be days away from deportation.His devastated 10-year-old daughter is barely talking or eating. All she does is cry. Theyre taking her to a psychologist, but Carmen doesnt know what else to do as she waits for word on whether officials will reopen her brothers case.\"Im so worried,\" she tells the church group, tears streaming down her face.Carmen says its sad to hear Winston-Salems \"welcoming city\" resolution hasnt passed. \"I dont know why they want to close the doors to us here,\" she says.The pastor offers a prayer for Carmen and others at the table.\"God, we put our worries and our anguish in front of you. ... Touch the hearts of the authorities in this country,\" he says. \"Touch the hardened hearts that they seem to have right now.\"Carmen bows her head.She prays for something she fears only God can give her now.Protection.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2017/04/30/us/winston-salem-welcoming-city-immigration/index.html"}, {"title": "Amazon natives hold on to tradition", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Qumperi is the shaman of the community, Pandya said, and he plays a very important role in the Huaorani culture. He is the healer of the community who has a trusted and vast knowledge of animals, plants and trees, including those which are used as poisons or medicines.This is Awa, the founder of Bameno, the largest Huaorani community in the Amazon.Macaws and parrots are a common sight in the Huaorani home, Pandya said. The Huaorani, which means \"the people,\" or \"human beings,\" are believed to have inhabited the Amazon rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.It was really fascinating to see how the Huaorani coexisted with animals, Pandya said. Even as hunters, they seemed to have very strict rules of what was deemed ethically acceptable and what was inhumane. Sometimes when they are out hunting, they kill a parent animal and bring its orphan child back to the community. They then nurture the baby until it is an adult.For his formal portraits, Pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the Huaorani in a very direct and concise manner, eliminating the presence of any distractions. It also highlights the coexistence between the Huaorani and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment.A portrait of Omayewei, one of the Huaorani people photographed by Trupal Pandya in Ecuador. Omayewei is an elder in his community, making him one of the few who still live a very primal or authentic way of life, Pandya said.Story highlights Photographer Trupal Pandya took portraits of the Huaorani people in Ecuadors rainforest The community is beginning to modernize, but it still maintains its traditional ways of livingCNN —Deep within the Amazonian rainforest of Ecuador live the Huaorani.Photographer Trupal Pandya traveled about 30 hours by air, water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits.The Huaorani, which means “the people” or “human beings,” are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.Pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.Diverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani.Trupal Pandya Photographer Trupal Pandya“The biggest (reason) was to just go out there and photograph the change before everything changes,” Pandya said. “I think if I would have (photographed the Huaorani) 10 years back down the line or a little later than that, I don’t think I would have got what I just got.”Another aspect of modernization has to do with language. Many Huaorani, who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect, now speak the Ecuadorian native language of Spanish.Pandya speaks English, so he needed translators to interact effectively. But it is apparent from his experiences with the Huaorani that actions can certainly not only speak louder than words, but be more effectual than words when attempting to convey one’s intentions.“I never started photographing when I (first) saw (the Huaorani),” he said. “I didn’t even have my camera. I waited to let them get used to me around them. I gave myself time to get a little easier around them. Even if you cannot talk in the same language, I feel that you definitely connect to them as a human being.”Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.Prior to creating formal portraits using his professional camera equipment and lighting, Pandya took Polaroid photos of the Huaorani that they were then able to keep.“I think some of them saw the Polaroid for the first time, so they were really happy to see themselves like that,” Pandya said.For his formal portraits, Pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the Huaorani in a very direct and concise manner, eliminating the presence of any distractions.“The main reason was to have the focus only on the people and their clothes and nothing else but them as an individual, them as a human being,” he said.Pandya’s decision to use a white background also proved effective in highlighting the coexistence between the Huaorani and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment.Creating portraits of the Huaorani has been a “fascinating, challenging” experience for Pandya, who is studying photography in New York at the Fashion Institute of Technology.After witnessing firsthand the simplicity in which the Huaorani live in harmony with their environment, Pandya said he finds himself thinking about and reflecting upon what it truly means to be satisfied and content with life.“I think the question I ask myself is: ‘Who’s richer?’ ” he said. “(This has been) a really big learning curve of how to just live a very beautiful, normal life.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/03/31/world/cnnphotos-huaorani-rainforest-ecuador/index.html"}, {"title": "Show animals and their proud handlers", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Daniel with his white Muscovy duck that won Best Waterfowl at a show in Somerset.Traditional Welsh pigs are judged at a show in Builth Wells, Wales.

Photographer Jooney Woodward thought his cheerfulness showed that \"sense of enjoyment\" handlers have when competing with their animals.Story highlights Jooney Woodward took portraits of show animals and their handlers in the UK The livestock shows are just as much business events as they are social gatheringsCNN —Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows.Jooney Woodward’s “Best in Show” is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals.“When you go to (the shows), they tend to be all about the animals – people photographing the animals,” Woodward said. “I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they’re so committed to what they do. They’re really devoted and hardworking.”While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward’s work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.“My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,” she said. “I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, ‘I’d love a portrait of you and your cow,’ everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they’re so passionate about what they do.”Jooney Woordward Photographer Jooney WoodwardThe “Best in Show” portraits lead viewers down a winding pathway to ponder those inexplicable yet noticeable connections and bonds that exist between the handlers and their animals.Woodward’s photos also contain subtle details. For example, the symbols and signs on the wall behind Wendy and her Hereford yearling heifer Mandalay Juliette are just as significant as the handler and her animal.“It’s just the way (Wendy) had gone through the effort of decorating the pen (with Union Jacks) where the cows were being kept,” Woodward said. “There’s also a sign behind (her) … and there’s a picture of a gentleman with a cow, who is actually her husband who had died a few years ago. … I just thought that was nice, something quite sentimental about that.”There are not only sentimental subtleties within “Best in Show,” but also fun and interesting ones as well. This is especially evident in the photo of the traditional Welsh pigs being judged, as Woodward points out there is an advertisement for sausages behind the pigs.Regardless of what elements make up Woodward’s photos, the emotions and aesthetics remain particularly important.I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they’re so committed to what they do. They’re really devoted and hardworking. Photographer Jooney WoodwardWoodward said that when photographing Jamie and his Jersey cow, his happiness and smile made her want to “share that sense of enjoyment” that handlers have when competing with their animals in the shows.What drew Woodward to Harriet and her guinea pig Gentleman Jack were the similar colors radiating from both of them. Her photo of the pair won the National Portrait Gallery’s Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize in 2011.“(Harriet) was like a steward, she was sort of judging the guinea pigs. And she also had her own guinea pig with her, which had red as well,” Woodward said. “I just thought that was incredibly striking. I thought, ‘I’ve got to get a shot of that.’ “The dynamics of the competitions foster a community atmosphere in which everybody becomes acquainted with one another after having traveled to different shows for so many years. Woodward said this was an enjoyable aspect of her work because “you get to see lots of familiar faces.”Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.She has learned about the pride the handlers have toward their animals, and many of her presumptions about the competitions have now changed after having worked on “Best in Show.”“I think when I first started going, I was sort of thinking the shows would be more novelty, fun things for these people,” she said. “But, actually, it isn’t really; it’s quite a serious thing, because they can make money from breeding.”In addition to handlers earning significant money from breeding, they are also able to achieve recognition for their livestock. Those competing have a lot at stake when they make the decision to travel and compete, because the shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings.The competitions are also rather family-oriented, and Woodward said that while adults compete, their sons, daughters and grandchildren are involved as well. The younger generations are likely to one day take over the responsibility of running the family farms, and everyone that participates seems to have a strong sense of pride and passion for agriculture.“I think it’s something I will always document for the rest of my life, and see how things change,” Woodward said. “It was challenging, insightful and fun.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/03/17/living/cnnphotos-british-show-animals/index.html"}, {"title": "Nineteen years under the rainbow", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Its all smiles for these two at the Hungary World Rainbow Gathering in 2014.Light rays power through colossal trees, illuminating tents and tepees.

According to Krivic, the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient Hopi Native American prophecy about “Rainbow Warriors.”Rainbow Gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals – peace, harmony, freedom and respect. Those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a “Rainbow Family.”The community, which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages, comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society’s popular culture of consumerism, materialism and mass media.Matjaz Krivic Photographer Matjaz KrivicThose who attend are not required to pay any form of money, not even for food, and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader. Instead, Rainbow Gatherings are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community’s beliefs in a more equitable society and its people’s love and tolerance for one another.“The magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want,” Krivic said. “(But) nobody needs to pay for the food. Everybody is welcome to go and eat there.”Krivic says that Rainbow Gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that “need to be healed” after having experienced devastating conflicts. Past gatherings include those held in Serbia, Bosnia and Ukraine.“I really don’t like what’s going on in this world. … There’s just so much stuff happening,” Krivic said. “You can always go to (Rainbow Gatherings) and stay there and have a nice time, and you don’t even have to pay for it. It will be a nice time, nice energy, not aggressive.”One of the most enjoyable aspects about Rainbow Gatherings is the many workshops and activities that are available, where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques.Another significant part of Rainbow Gatherings is the all-encompassing sound.“I like the music, I’m an audiophile. I like all sorts of music, but when I go there it’s live, it’s there,” Krivic said. “It’s like two guys playing and eventually it’s like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful.”The first Rainbow Gathering took place in Colorado in 1972, and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture “tribes” from Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Since then, the gatherings have extended to other areas in the United States as well as a number of different countries.The international gatherings generally take place during the summer, before August’s full moon. According to Krivic, the exact locations of some of the Rainbow Gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past.Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.Krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at Rainbow Gatherings, and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography. Ever since his first Rainbow Gathering, Krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses.“The gatherings didn’t change,” Krivic said, “but my photography did change – a lot. … I consider photography differently now.”Krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital, which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings. He also had to carefully decide who to photograph.“I had some friends and I could take photos of them, and then eventually when I was going on and on, it just became like a family,” he said. “It’s like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year.”Just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way, “Somewhere Under the Rainbow” enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos, leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations.In one photo, Krivic takes viewers to Pakistan in 1998, where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands.It’s then 2003 in France.

You can follow her on Twitter. The views expressed are her own.CNN —The image of the braided Kurdish female fighter, donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group ISIS, may have done more to promote the Kurdish cause in the West than anything else in recent years.The Iraqi Kurds have long been pro-Western in orientation, but Western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support, in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence. Now, with soccer moms in Middle America tweeting photos of Kurdish female fighters, Western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid Kurdish policies to their constituencies.Jacob Russell’s sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of Kurdish female fighters.Cyrus Moussavi Photographer Jacob RussellSince last summer, international media – and Kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images – often objectified these women. Images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour (“girls with guns,” as Russell calls this type of portrayal) tend to portray more of the photographer’s assumptions about the woman’s emancipation than her actual experiences as a Kurdish woman in combat.Russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters.“I was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters,” he said. “I think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by Kurdish leaders (who) know very well how attractive this image is to the Western media.”Having lived in Kurdistan for nearly two years, Russell understands that many women join the Peshmerga or other Kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons.

He asks them if he can come inside.The 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell.“Most of the kids, they’ve never had that kind of respect,” he said. “But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they’re looking down on me.”Ross doesn’t begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation.“I say, ‘What’s gone on in your life?’ “The result of that tenderness and patience is Ross’ latest collection of photos, “Girls in Justice.”The images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person’s life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images.Richard Ross Photographer Richard RossOne photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room.“I’ve been here 17 times,” one girl says.Many of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them.“Mom’s a stripper.

I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do.”The photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn’t the girls’ – it’s ours as a society for jailing children.His images aren’t always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire.

I was sobbing. You want to say, ‘It will get better,’ but you also know the system and you know that you can’t say that.”Ross, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system.But times were different then, he said, and there’s been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child’s bad behavior.He recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class.“This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle,” Ross recalled. “He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school.”You want to say, ‘It will get better,’ but you also know the system and you know that you can’t say that. Richard RossThe child’s single mother couldn’t pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn’t allow her to leave until after 6 p.m.The detention-center director sent Ross’ photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution.Ross is adamant that he’s making photographs to bring about “immediate change.”He speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing.“I’m trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake,” he said. “At the same time, I don’t, I can’t, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen.

The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014.Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or “cat fight.” There’s no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they’ve decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it’s a place for women to shed the roles they play outside.“When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,” said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. “Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.”Katarzyna Mazur Photographer Katarzyna MazurAt first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn’t satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action.“It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,” she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. “I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.”For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn’t always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning “How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?”Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.“I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,” she said.She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too – they’re mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives.Even years later, the fight club is still running and is “better than ever,” Mazur said.“Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,” Mazur said. “It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/03/15/living/cnnphotos-female-fight-club/index.html"}, {"title": "Crawling in a ‘polio-free’ country", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Someone gives money to Kumar in November. \"Indian people only give one or two rupees,\" he told del Estal. \"I prefer foreign people; they give 10 rupees or more.\"Dharmender lies on a bed in St. Stephens Hospital a few days before his surgery.

You try to lift your hand to accept, but you can’t. The muscles are paralyzed, and your mind can’t command them to move. You use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee. Then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day.This is everyday life for Bipin Kumar. Kumar, known as BK, contracted polio as a child, and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives. Kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him, so he moved to New Delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could – begging on the streets.Photographer Elena del Estal was in India last year when the World Health Organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country. It had been exactly three years since the last contracted case. Del Estal was fascinated by this. She couldn’t help but wonder about those already living with the crippling effects of this horrible disease.Elena del Estal Photographer Elena del EstalShe traveled to a small village near Kolkata to meet a little girl who was India’s last case of polio. This gave her the inspiration to begin a long-term project on those suffering in a country that’s now “polio-free.”First she met a boy named Dharmender who lived in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India. Even though his village was poor, his family took good care of him. Del Estal spent time with him and accompanied him during a surgical procedure in New Delhi. She said that while Dharmender is very fortunate to have the opportunity for surgery, he will still never have a “normal” life.“His daily life is hard. … Everybody around him was working and having a family, and he cannot have this,” Del Estal said. “So on one hand, it’s (a) hard situation, and on the other hand, it’s easier than the other boy I met.”She’s speaking of Kumar, the young man who moved to New Delhi to support himself and his elderly mother back home in a village up north. Del Estal first met Kumar when she was wrapping up the first segment of her project. From the beginning, she said, he was very trusting, allowing her into his daily life.Del Estal was intent on capturing an authentic portrayal of Kumar’s life – the everyday logistics of moving through a city without one’s limbs at command. She said she was amazed at how adept he was at maneuvering his world. He could carry notebooks with his neck, grasp a pencil in between his clutched fingers, smoke a cigarette using his feet and prop his arms on his knees to move them forward.Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.Between the two of them – Del Estal speaking a little Hindi and Kumar speaking a little English – they wove a patchwork language of friendship and understanding. Kumar told her of his love interest – a girl who had feelings for him as well – but her parents would never allow their union.Del Estal said that while Kumar wants a job, employment is next to impossible for someone in his condition. But his spirit is tenacious. He knows how to read and write and he is skilled at taking care of himself. Before heading to the main bazaar in New Delhi every day, he washes and dresses himself. There are no days off for him. As shops open and tourists fumble through a foreign world in flip-flops and Bermuda shorts, Kumar positions himself in a visible location and smiles and greets everyone who passes with, “Namaste.”Del Estal has been so impacted by his friendship that she said her next plans are to do a project on his life.“I want to go to his village to meet his mother and keep taking pictures about his life because he is such a beautiful person,” she said. “It’s such a sad (circumstance) yet amazing life.

He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn’t photograph outside the hospital compound.“I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. … They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,” ten Hoopen said.With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.Pieter ten Hoopen Photographer Pieter ten HoopenThe studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.“This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,” ten Hoopen said.The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.The photos span several generations – some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered – a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.“They got very serious, they sat down upright. … I tried to say as little as possible,” he said. “I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative … and their unique perspective.”The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.“I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe … just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,” ten Hoopen said.He said some patients at the hospital “had being laying there for months in their room. … Then you take them out, it’s a little treat to get them out of their own misery. … That’s why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.”Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.I build classic photo studios … just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten HoopenHawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.“I really can appreciate old portraiture … when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,” he said. “It’s a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.”How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?“It wasn’t hard,” he said. “I just told them to relax and have fun.“Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don’t blame them.

To get a contract, 75% of a company’s work must be performed by the severely disabled, people who cannot get work elsewhere.Yet, numerous sources have told CNN that SourceAmerica awards contracts unfairly, giving lucrative deals to companies with inside connections. Some SourceAmerica board members have also worked at companies that are awarded big contracts.One such example is outlined in a lawsuit alleging bid-rigging, one of several suits filed against AbilityOne and SourceAmerica in recent years.The suit was filed by Ruben Lopez, owner of Bona Fide Conglomerates, a company that lost a contract bid to clean the federal courthouse in Las Vegas. Another company owned by Lopez had already been cleaning the courthouse for years and had received glowing reviews. Lopez lost the bid, and the contract was given to another company that had an official sitting on the board of directors at SourceAmerica.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.Eventually, Lopez settled the Las Vegas contract dispute with SourceAmerica. As part of the settlement, SourceAmerica agreed to treat Lopez’s company more fairly, even appointing their top lawyer, Jean Robinson, to work with him.But Lopez said his company was blackballed instead and received no more contracts. Lopez sued SourceAmerica again, claiming it violated the settlement agreement, and that claim is now ongoing in the courts.Lopez became so disgusted with how corrupt the process was that he began working with federal investigators and secretly recorded conversations between himself and Robinson.What is AbilityOne? The AbilityOne program was first created with ambitious, altruistic goals by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress in 1938 to help give jobs to the blind.Those recordings, which CNN obtained independently, are now part of the federal investigation, having been requested under the grand jury subpoena.The recordings are striking, among other reasons, because Robinson compared her company’s leadership to the leadership of the mafia.“They’re like – they’re like the mafia, I mean, and they pride themselves in it. They don’t care,” Robinson is heard saying in one part of the recordings.“You know, we are dealing with the mafia here, the old – the old SourceAmerica mafia,” she said in another recording.On the recordings, Robinson confides she is nervous about being set up by a board of directors she claims has been fraudulently awarding contracts for decades.“People have been doing it for so many years, and they’re not going to stop,” she said. “They’re just – it’s like an addiction. They’re just, so much time has passed, they’ve been getting away with it for, you know, for what, 25 years, and they don’t know how to do it different.”Officials at SourceAmerica and AbilityOne repeatedly declined interviews with CNN, issuing statements denying fraud, corruption, cronyism, bid rigging, or illegal activity.The recordings of Robinson, SourceAmerica writes, are “factually inaccurate and untrue.” The statement notes that Lopez, head of what it calls a “disgruntled” nonprofit, is suing SourceAmerica.

The university was considering a moratorium on all fraternity events, but decided just three days before Hipps died to hold off.It would later come out that Sigma Phi Epsilon violated five rules while Hipps was pledging, including violations related to hazing, harm to person, alcohol and organizational conduct. The university did not answer when asked by CNN if officials were aware of those five SigEp violations prior to Hipps’ death.Hipps, 19, died after he fell, jumped or was pushed off a bridge during a predawn run that was against the fraternity’s hazing policy. There’s an open criminal investigation and the family is suing the university and three fraternity members, who all have denied knowing how he died.His parents say it was not for lack of trying that they did not know about the fraternity’s problems.Hipps’ father, in particular, was opposed to his son joining a fraternity at Clemson.“His dad was totally against it in the beginning,” his mother said earlier this year. Cindy Hipps said she’d done her due diligence, even attending a Greek orientation meeting, which she said put her mind at ease.“After that class I felt better about it,” she said. “They said kids in frats have better time management skills, set study times, did it as a group activity. Those kids had higher grade point averages. All the things a mother wants to hear, I heard. I convinced his dad to let him do it. Never once did I ever feel like my child would be harmed in any way.”When she checked out Clemson’s Greek life website, she saw only positive information, such as links to the average GPAs of each fraternity and sorority. There were two references to hazing policy, but nothing that explained which fraternities or sororities had been cited for violating those rules.But at that time, Clemson officials were concerned about “unprecedented conduct issues over the course of first 3 weeks of school,” at several of the school’s fraternities, according to internal documents obtained by CNN.After Hipps’ death, Clemson added a list of suspended fraternities to its website.If Hipps’ already-apprehensive parents had known what was going on at Clemson, they say, they would have pulled their son out of Greek life immediately.Dangers are not mythsWest Virginia University, Clemson and Penn State are not the only universities that brag about philanthropy, brotherhood and connections for life on their Greek life websites. Most schools list only the positives.Clemson’s says “Greek organizations do hold social events, but most of these do not include alcohol.”Penn State’s goes as far as to say: “For many parents, the fraternity and sorority community reminds them of images of the movie Animal House. There are many myths about the fraternity and sorority community, but the reality is that men and women in fraternities and sororities are committed to their academics, volunteer their time in the community, develop and strengthen their leadership skills, and form a campus network with other fraternity and sorority members.”That kind of language outrages Doug Fierberg, an attorney for the Braham family, who recently sued Penn State on the family’s behalf and who has handled dozens of university misconduct cases in his career.“The dangers of fraternities are not myths. They are reality,” Fierberg said. “The failure by universities to tell the truth about the risks facing students in fraternities specifically related to hazing misuse and abuse of alcohol and other misconduct is the new battleground.”“It needs to be changed nationally, because parents and students are entitled to timely and accurate information about the risks they face. And universities have no basis, morally or legally, to withhold that information from the university community,” he said.Some universities don’t post a hazing policy on their Greek sites. For example, at West Virginia University, it’s posted separately on the campus police site. (West Virginia University told CNN it is considering a number of changes, including “better and more timely communication.”)Others have listed it in online FAQs, several clicks away from the positives.There are very few universities that list fraternity infractions on their websites, and even when they do, it’s often difficult to determine what the infractions really mean.For example, after the 2008 alcohol poisoning death of Brett Griffin, 18, at the University of Delaware, Fierberg sued on behalf of the family and forced Delaware to change its Greek life site to list violations. But the list is vague, just listing things like “multiple violations” or “social policy violations” or “hazing/alcohol” without details of the incidents.“You’re looking at best practices,” Fierberg said, referring to the University of Delaware site. “What’s ‘multiple violations’? Were people hurt? Was a student hospitalized? What does it take to get suspended?”Northern Illinois University adopted a policy of putting sanctions on its website after the 2012 death of David Bogenberger, a 19-year-old pledge who was forced to drink alcohol and died. (Twenty-two brothers from the Phi Kappa Alpha fraternity were criminally charged and sentenced to two years of court supervision, plus community service.) Three months after his death, NIU made the change, but the list isn’t on the Greek life website – and it’s so hard to find, CNN had to ask the university to point out where it is. (It’s on a separate page, one for the Office of Community Standards & Student Conduct.)from Twitter David BogenbergerThe relationship between universities and fraternities can be confusing, since many of them reside off-campus and are chartered by national organizations. But Fierberg said universities violate their duties to students and parents when they create websites about Greek life and only include feel-good information, instead of an accurate and complete picture.And national fraternities are no better.The only major fraternity that lists its violations is Sigma Alpha Epsilon, according to Fierberg, and that’s because he sued SAE after the 2008 death of a fraternity pledge at California Polytechnic State University and forced it to list prior violations online.Carson Starkey, 18, died of alcohol poisoning following an event where pledges were forced to drink alcohol, vomit, and drink some more. The SAE chapter at Cal Poly had a prior drug violation before the death, according to Cal Poly.“(Universities) won’t give you the full information because it will confirm that what you believe is right,” Fierberg said. “Of course you have a zero tolerance policy. (Hazing is) illegal. … But why wouldn’t you tell parents it’s still going on?”Fierberg said he suspects that the universities don’t even write their own language for these Greek life information sites, since many of them look the same. In fact, a Google search of “myth” and “Greek life” and “hazing” and “.edu” shows nearly identical definitions of hazing on the websites of dozens of schools.Mental health emergenciesMarquise Braham jumped off the roof of a Marriott in Nassau County, New York, in March of 2014, the same year that Hipps and Burch died. A source close to the case says there was evidence of alcohol-fueled physical and sexual hazing prior to Braham’s suicide.from Facebook Marquise BrahamFierberg is representing Braham’s family in its lawsuit against Penn State.Fierberg claims the university was aware there were “serious concerns” about the “well-being and psychological health” of Braham, 18, in the days leading up to his suicide.Phi Sigma Kappa told CNN it hasn’t seen the lawsuit and will not comment.The police chief in Logan Township, Pennsylvania, where the satellite campus he attended is located, told local reporters that Braham had discussed hazing at his fraternity with an aunt and with several friends. The case is under investigation by the state attorney general, but no charges have been filed. The fraternity was suspended. Penn State said it couldn’t comment on Braham’s death, because of his family’s pending lawsuit, but admitted there are times when the university reaches out to parents to notify them of harmful situations.“Emergency in this context includes mental health emergencies as well,” university spokeswoman Lisa Powers said in an email. “In general, and in accordance with privacy laws and practices, when we have a student emergency we balance the critical nature/seriousness of the situation with the student’s privacy rights as we make the decision to contact parents, or not.”Many universities say they alert parents of health risks, such as when a student contracts a contagious disease, but there is no such pattern of reporting when it comes to other potential threats, like hazing.In addition to Hipps and Burch, there is the 2010 death of Samuel Mason, 20, who was allegedly made to drink a bottle of liquor in an hour while pledging Tau Kappa Epsilon at Radford University in Virginia. Radford University says that chapter of TKE had been found in violation of university policy earlier that year for serving alcohol to minors at a fraternity social event. His family sued and settled with the national fraternity and several of the local chapter’s members.And the death of Armando Villa, a 19-year-old at California State University-Northridge, pledging Pi Kappa Phi, who died during a hazing-related 18-mile August hike where, his family lawsuit alleges, he and other pledges weren’t given enough water. His fraternity had been cited for not completing required education programs and for holding unregistered events, and had just been reinstated after a suspension when the hike took place. A spokesman for the family says his mother, Betty Serrato, didn’t know about the suspension and says that if she had, she would have tried to talk her son out of pledging that fraternity.Neither Radford or CSUN has sanctions posted on its website, although CSUN told CNN it is considering putting them online.“It’s sad. It’s really sad,” Kim Burch said. “If we had known this was going on, we would have never let him join this fraternity. I never in my life thought I was sending a 17-year-old kid off to end up two months later gone. It’s repulsive. He would have been better off joining the Marines and going to war.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/11/02/us/fraternity-hazing-deaths/index.html"}, {"title": "The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos", "data_published": "set()", "content": "WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 17: The sun begins to rise behind the U.S. Capitol building on the morning after a bipartisan bill was passed by the House and the Senate to reopened the government and raise the debt limit, on October 17, 2013 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Ryan: I want women to get the care they needStory highlights Filmmaker admits fetus images were taken from Internet Mother of stillborn infant says her babys photos were usedCosta Mesa, California CNN —David Daleiden wanted to show exactly what a 19-week-old aborted fetus, being held in the hands of a medical technician, looked like. The problem was he didn’t have that picture. So he went to the Internet, found something close and inserted it into his documentary.The photo, two cupped hands holding a tiny male fetus, appeared on screen as dramatic music played. Against this backdrop, a medical technician detailed how she was present when an intact 19-week gestated fetus was aborted at a Planned Parenthood clinic and, she says, harvested for tissue samples.Daleiden’s video failed to mention that the photo and the story do not match.Abortion photo actually stillborn childThe photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic. It was the stillborn child of Alexis Fretz, whose son was stillborn in 2013. Fretz took the photo and posted it on the Internet to memorialize the son she named Walter.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.Without Fretz’s knowledge, Daleiden and his two-man documentary group called the Center for Medical Progress plucked that photo from her web page and dropped it into his anti-Planned Parenthood documentary.“Was it clear?” Fretz asks herself in a CNN interview, “No it was not clear. Was it deceitful? I don’t know that.”Daleiden told CNN the fact that the photo is not an actual photo of an aborted fetus makes no difference. He insists the fetus is the same age as the one referred to in his film, and he used it only as an illustration.Misleading video cited in Republican debateDaleiden also is being criticized for a second, potentially misleading use of video that has found its way into the Republican presidential campaign. GOP candidate Carly Fiorina cited a portion of the Center for Medical Progress videos in which an intact fetus kicks its left leg and moves an arm shortly after being aborted.Fiorina described the video during CNN’s Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential library on September 16, using the horrific image in her call for an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.In an interview in Southern California earlier this month, Daleiden now admits he has no information on where the video was actually taken. There is no evidence it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic.Daleiden says the image came from an outside source, an anti-abortion group called the Center For Bioethical Reform and he doesn’t know its origin beyond that. A spokesman for the group tells CNN it won’t disclose the location either, only that the video in question was paid for. Despite its source, Daleiden again insists the video is only used as an illustration of what an intact aborted fetus would look like, not the actual fetus referred to in his film.03:55 - Source: CNN Checking Fiorinas claims on an anti-abortion videoCritics call videos heavily edited, discreditedThe two examples of misleading pictures and video have allowed Planned Parenthood and its supporters to label the Center for Medical Progress’s entire production a fraud.Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president with Planned Parenthood, repeated the defense the women’s health group and its many supporters have been trying to convey since the first of the Center for Medical Progress’s nine videos began to be released online.“All of the tapes and footage David Daleiden has released out into the world has been heavily edited,” Laguens told CNN. “And I think pretty thoroughly discredited.”Daleiden insists the two uses of video and photos are not misleading, and says the entire controversy has been manufactured by Planned Parenthood and its “allies in the mainstream media” in order to divert attention from the main point of his documentary: that Planned Parenthood uses aborted fetal tissue as a revenue source.Planned Parenthood: Fast facts and revealing numbersPlanned Parenthood ends paymentsThe Center for Medical Progress spent several years taping Planned Parenthood employees, medical directors and some of its affiliate partners discussing the technique, costs and reimbursement payments for the harvesting of fetal tissue samples for scientific research.The filming was done without knowledge of those speaking. In several instances, CMP argues that Planned Parenthood representatives appear to be bargaining, negotiating and detailing the best ways to collect or “harvest” aborted fetuses for maximum financial gain.In one episode, Dr. Mary Gatter, a medical director for Planed Parenthood, is filmed during a meal discussing her proposal that each tissue sample harvested should fetch a $75 charge.Since selling fetal tissue samples is illegal, Planned Parenthood has been quick to label the transactions as reimbursement costs and that they were made only at a tiny fraction of the organization’s 700 clinics and affiliates. Planned Parenthood executives continue to claim the videos are heavily edited, taken out of context and deceptive.But last week Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement costs at any of its clinics for the transfer of fetal tissue-samples. In a letter to the National Institutes of Health, Planned Parenthood’s president defended her organization and insisted all transactions in the past were legal. But says the new change in policy was being taken “…in order to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.”Contacted after the announcement, Daleiden says the sudden change in policy is an admission that he and his videos were right.“If the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts were truly legitimate ‘reimbursement,’ why cancel it?” Daleiden wrote in a statement to CNN. “This proves what the Center for Medical Progress has been saying all along – Planned Parenthood incurs no actual costs, and the payments for harvested fetal parts have always been an extra profit margin.”How exactly fetal tissue is used for medicine", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/10/19/politics/planned-parenthood-videos/index.html"}, {"title": "Sources: Disabled work program mired in fraud", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights CNN exclusive: AbilityOne and SourceAmerica are under investigation AbilityOne program funnels about $3 billion per year of taxpayer money to fund contracts for goods and services Sources say the agency is allowing jobs to be taken away from disabled peopleCNN —The nation’s premier federal program that provides work for people who are severely disabled is mired in widespread corruption, financial fraud and violations of the law, numerous sources tell CNN. And instead of helping the severely disabled find work, the taxpayer-funded agency is at times allowing jobs to be taken away from the disabled, the sources say.AbilityOne, along with the nonprofit agency that manages its program for the severely disabled, SourceAmerica, are being investigated by authorities for illegal operations, financial fraud, mismanagement, operating in violation of the law, steering of contracts, and possibly obstruction of justice. Several inside sources tell CNN the program is among the worst cases of its type they’ve ever seen in a federal agency.CNN has learned the U.S. Department of Justice has begun its own investigation into the various allegations. In addition, at least four separate inspectors general offices have active investigations into AbilityOne and SourceAmerica. The OIG from the General Services Administration, Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration and the State Department are among those investigating; their investigation is being led by the State Department IG.What is AbilityOne? The AbilityOne program was first created with ambitious, altruistic goals by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress in 1938 to help give jobs to the blind.The AbilityOne program funnels about $3 billion per year of taxpayer money to fund contracts for goods and services across the country. For a company to get a contract with AbilityOne, 75% of that company’s work must be performed by blind or severely disabled employees, who cannot work in a normal job.But CNN has learned that as many as half the companies contracting with SourceAmerica under AbilityOne may be operating in violation of the law, without enough severely disabled employees, according to sources with knowledge of the program. There are no such allegations of wrongdoing with AbilityOne’s contracts for blind people.What this means is the program responsible for making sure severely disabled people are being hired with taxpayer money through federal contracts is not enforcing or following the law, according to numerous inside sources with knowledge of the organization.AbilityOne is run by a commission made up of presidential appointees. While they must approve all contracts, sources tell CNN they are essentially a “rubber stamp,” for the referrals sent to them by SourceAmerica, which essentially operates independently with contracts for the severely disabled. So, one key allegation is that SourceAmerica, a nonprofit agency with virtually no oversight other than AbilityOne, largely decides how roughly $2.3 billion in U.S. taxpayer money is spent, according to numerous sources.“The contracts are now being funneled to a very small group of 10 large companies that are getting way more than their fair share,” said former congressional investigator Rich Beutel, who now lobbies for companies in the industry, including one that’s suing SourceAmerica.Beutel and numerous other sources tell CNN the staffers who are essentially handing out federal contracts at SourceAmerica are heavily influenced by top officials there, and those top SourceAmerica officials are often connected to the very businesses that get the contracts – sometimes even in top leadership.Several lawsuits have been filed in recent years accusing AbilityOne and SourceAmerica of awarding contracts not on the basis of merit, but rather through unfair influence by decision-makers who have interest in the outcome.“So that you have actual advisers and board members in these private organizations who are themselves business owners; and so they can award themselves potentially contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Beutel. “It’s a perfect setup for waste and abuse,” he said.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.The agency denies those accusations. “No one involved in making award recommendations to the commission is employed by an organization seeking those contracts,” read the statement sent to CNN. “We want to be very clear, SourceAmerica board members are not involved in the evaluation of contract bids or recommendations to the AbilityOne Commission.”Read the full statement from SourceAmericaDisabled losing jobsIt took Randall Love years to find work after a tumor on his spine left him nearly paralyzed in 2008. The IT professional struggled through physical therapy to even be able to move in his home, and he can’t travel to hold down a regular job. He finally found work at home through an AbilityOne contract, and it changed everything for him.“It gives me … a sense of being worthwhile, a sense of being able to contribute to things, a sense of being able to help others,” said Love. “I get up just like everybody else in the morning. And I go to work, too. I’m not disabled. That’s why I say it’s the cure for me,” he said.But Love and numerous other disabled people were left jobless when the company that hired them, NTI, lost its AbilityOne contract to a company named Peckham Industries. NTI officials appealed the contract award multiple times detailing what they call “overwhelming evidence” that Peckham would “not be in compliance” with the 75% requirement under law.Mary Joan Willard, the executive director of Boston-based NTI, blames the government for not having a system of checking whether a company is compliant. Willard and NTI have sued the U.S. government, and by extension, AbilityOne and SourceAmerica, in the contract dispute.Peckham disputes NTI’s allegations, saying in a statement to CNN, “We are now put in a position of being a victim of false allegations by an unsuccessful bidder. … The fact is that Peckham EXCEEDS the 75% requirement with a proven record of employment of severely disabled about 80%. Peckham has consistently maintained the required ratio for persons with severe disabilities served through the AbilityOne program.” When CNN asked for proof of the employment numbers, Peckham declined, citing ongoing litigation.CNN has been told by multiple sources there is no real verification process in AbilityOne or Source America to determine whether severely disabled workers are being hired in the proper ratio and the contracts are operating legally. “Their definition of ‘verified’ is they look at a piece of paper that Peckham has signed saying, ‘We are in compliance … these people are severely disabled.’ And that, to me, is not verification,” said Willard.Meanwhile, workers like Love are furious they lost work. “I tell my kids this all the time – that you always must do the right thing,” said Love. “Doing the right thing … doesn’t mean that you put 16 disabled people out of work. Doing the right thing also means … that you don’t replace them with people who don’t have disabilities.”Numerous sources with direct knowledge of AbilityOne and Source America contracts tell CNN there are many companies contracting through AbilityOne and Source America across the country that do not meet the government’s rule of having a 75% severely disabled workforce, made up of people who cannot perform other jobs.“The majority of the individuals that were being hired were not severely disabled,” one inside source told CNN. This source worked for years as a hiring manager inside one of the big contractors that gets many AbilityOne contracts, through SourceAmerica. This person knows the program very well, but asked CNN not to reveal their identity because they still have close contacts in that world. The source cited numerous examples of contracts operating illegally and out of compliance.“I would say in my experience in the AbilityOne contracts that I worked on, maybe 10 to 20 percent were truly severely disabled; they truly did not have the ability to find gainful employment elsewhere. Everybody else – they were capable of finding employment elsewhere,” the source said. What the source witnessed would be illegal, because the contracts would be out of compliance.Asked if anyone in the program ever actually checked to objectively verify if the contracts were operating legally with the right number of severely disabled people, the anonymous source told CNN: “Not that I’m aware of. I mean, we tracked numbers for our own record-keeping to ensure that we met that 75%. But as far as any type of documentation being turned over to AbilityOne to actually show, ‘Hey, these individuals have a severe disability,’ I’m not aware that that ever took place.”“As long as you have a report that says 75% of my staff is disabled, there’s no other checking,” the source said, adding the program is both a “ripoff” of taxpayers and also an affront to disabled people who want and need to work in the special contracts.CNN heard similar allegations from numerous sources across the country. SourceAmerica says they conduct on-site visits, but according to their statement: “SourceAmerica staff does not determine compliance; only the U.S. AbilityOne Commission is authorized to do so.”Even on the rare occasions when companies are cited by AbilityOne officials for not being in compliance, nothing happens, numerous sources told CNN. In recent years, CNN has learned, at least 80 letters were sent to contractors from AbilityOne officials stating the contracts were in violation of the law and out of compliance, and demanding they submit explanations. But only about half the companies even bothered to respond or explain why they were operating illegally.Have a tip? The Office of Inspector General has a tip line for anyone with information about AbilityOne or SourceAmerica. It is oighotline@state.gov or 800-409-9926.What’s more, none of the companies operating illegally were disciplined in any way, according to sources. And these letters were only sent to the violators that self-reported their low numbers out of compliance, or where the small AbilityOne team tasked with overseeing the enormous program managed to discover violations.CNN has also learned there are many contracts operating across the country that have not been seen by any AbilityOne compliance officials in years and even decades in some cases, despite the fact they are supposed to be seen regularly. And sources tell CNN the legally required documentation on severely disabled workers is rarely completed and turned in to AbilityOne officials by contractors.The contracts are awarded for all kinds of products that are made through the program and can be seen in the comprehensive online catalog. AbilityOne workers also do many services with the contracts, such as answer phones at call centers, janitorial cleaning and laundry work, often at government buildings or on military bases.While CNN has learned there are at least four inspectors general now with active investigations, none of them is officially tasked with oversight of the program or agency, and none has complete authority over it. They are pursuing it because of concerns that have been raised about specific contracts under their jurisdiction.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/07/27/us/disabled-work-program-investigation/index.html"}, {"title": "Athletes allege abuse, racism at U. of Illinois", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights Athletes at the University of Illinois accuse coaches of harassment CNN spoke to 15 recently departed players on the football and womens basketball team The universitys athletic director acknowledges the allegations are serious and call into question the culture of the programCNN —They called it the “dog pound.”It was a separate practice for women’s basketball players at the University of Illinois, a majority of them black, where athletes were often allegedly harassed and attacked for things that had nothing to do with basketball.Like the neighborhoods where they grew up. Or their family life.It was common, these women told CNN, for an assistant coach to refer to race, and to tell them their “culture” was “poison” or “toxic” to the starting team, which was predominantly white. During road games, the players say they were segregated – black players separated from the white ones in hotel rooms.It was so bad, the women said, four players from this past season transferred out of the program at the University of Illinois to other schools.Nearby, at the university’s Memorial Stadium, some members of the football team say they were being harassed too. They recalled two instances where players were physically hit by their coach.Another player, with Type 1 diabetes, said he was shamed about his weight.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.CNN has spoken to 15 recently departed players on the football and women’s basketball teams, and they allege a wide range of misconduct and persistent bullying of athletes by coaches.In addition, players and their families have complained to CNN that they were pressured to play through injuries that go far beyond the typical tough nature of college sports. In one case, a women’s basketball player says she was forced to play with an injured toe that ended up being diagnosed as a broken foot. Athletes on the football team also complained that injuries were not taken seriously – one recalling a time when coaches threatened from the sidelines that he would lose his scholarship as he limped across the field with a knee injury.Overall, students and parents on both teams say there was a culture of coaches bullying students, with frequent threats to take away their scholarships even though university policy says an athlete can’t lose his or her scholarship because of injury or performance in sport.The university’s athletic director, Mike Thomas, acknowledged that the allegations are serious and call into question the culture of the program.“I was certainly troubled by all the allegations. And those allegations don’t match our core values,” he said. “Certainly our student athletes need to be in an environment that’s safe, that’s healthy, that takes their well-being as primary importance.”Women’s basketball head coach Matt Bollant and head football coach Tim Beckman declined to comment through a university spokeswoman.“Look at what the university has to lose,” said Lydia Tuck, the mother of one former women’s basketball player. “I’m sure they’re worried about Title IX funding. I’m sure they hope that we go away.”Racism alleged on women’s basketball teamThe women’s basketball team lost four girls to transfer this year – all for the same reasons: They allege pervasive emotional abuse.Eight former players – seven of them have since sued the university – talked to CNN, and all said that assistant coach Mike Divilbiss verbally attacked players daily, going after them for personal issues such as learning disabilities, family life or the neighborhood in which they grew up. Divilbiss could not be reached for comment.“The way he would attack you personally was just horrible,” said Jacqui Grant, a former player.“He came after my character,” said former player Alexis Smith, claiming that Divilbiss reprimanded her for moving into the same apartment as two of her teammates who were Bollant’s recruits. “He said, ‘I feel like you are trying to poison these girls. Why did you even move in with them? You are trying to poison them.’ ““When I tried to defend myself,” she added, “he was like, ‘Don’t try to come after me, I’m the wrong person.’ “Kierra Morris, who left the team after being put on medical disability, said the coaches told her they didn’t want her “culture carrying over” to their new recruits.Another former player, Amarah Coleman said that race was a constant underlying distinction and that Divilbiss often said things like, “you know how black people play.”And another former player, Taylor Tuck, said Divilbiss made a comment about three black players sitting together at a restaurant, saying, “All the black girls are sitting together, that’s segregated.”Divilbiss left the university after coming to what administrators call a “mutual understanding” with Bollant, following complaints from some parents, but Bollant remains in his position.Several former players or their parents told CNN that separate practices were held for the team – one practice group was majority black, and called “the dog pound,” which the players understood to mean they were not in favor. The other practice group was majority white, made up of the starters on the team. In addition, tension between the groups was encouraged, parents wrote in letters of complaint to the university in April.The players said those in the “dog pound” were called “crabs,” which, on a conference call, seven of the players explained like this: “Crabs can never get out of a bucket because they always pull each other down. That is how he explained it in practice. … They all just climb on top of each other and pull each other down. Like, bums, we are just dragging everybody down.”Coleman said she felt uncomfortable when her team was preparing to play one that was majority African-American, “because coach Divilbiss would single out the blacks on the team to talk about what the other black team was thinking. … The division of the team during that time made it feel like coach was thinking all blacks think alike.”She continued with more examples: “In practice when a black player would do a certain move, he (Divilbiss) would make a comment stating ‘that’s the West Side coming out’ (referring to Chicago’s predominantly black West Side). People should be proud of where they are from, but coach was saying it to make fun of where they are from.”Recruitment by a previous coachSix of the former players who spoke to CNN said that Divilbiss made several comments that singled out the black players who were primarily recruited by the previous coach, also an African-American, from the white players who were primarily recruited by Bollant.The players say race wasn’t the only factor that led to their mistreatment; they say they believe it also had to do with the fact that they were recruited by a previous coach.“It was a combination. Like you were African-American, and you weren’t recruited by them,” former player Nia Oden said.In their lawsuit, and in interviews with CNN, the women said they were divided by race when sharing hotel rooms during road games.After the women’s parents complained in April, the school did an internal investigation through its diversity council, and “preliminary findings” found no wrongdoing when it came to the allegations of racism and bullying.That led to an outcry from former players and their parents. And in response to them and to questions from CNN, the university announced five days later that it had hired a Chicago law firm to “finalize the preliminary review” that found no wrongdoing.“There’s no rush to judgment. You know we will go through an investigative process, and when that process is complete we will look at the next steps,” said Thomas, the university’s athletic director. “… I think you and I could be watching practice, and you could hear a coach say something to two different kids, those two different kids might take it a different way and you and I might take it a different way. So I think for coaches, not just at the University of Illinois but across the country, these are the kind of things that we’re going to be paying attention to moving forward.”The university has also hired a separate law firm to look at the claims of medical mistreatment on different teams. Allegations now include a lawsuit filed on June 8 by a former Illinois soccer player who says her concussion was mishandled.The suit says the university failed to follow its own protocol for handling concussions when defender Casey Conine was injured, returning her to play before doctors cleared her.’A culture of mental and emotional abuse’Divilbiss’ departure comes after three sets of parents wrote letters to the administration in late April.In one of the letters, Tuck, the former player, and her husband wrote that bullying and racial tension on the team are systematic and “epidemic,” and they accused Bollant, the women’s basketball head coach, of creating “a culture of mental and emotional abuse.”The family of another player, Taylor Gleason, wrote that she was “bullied and demoralized daily” and was forced to play with an injured toe, which later was diagnosed as a broken foot.“She’s just happy to be at a new school and starting over,” her father told CNN later. “Just happy to be out of there.”Many of the players who left are now playing at other schools, and they said they are having much different and much better experiences.Tom Grusecki, the stepfather of one former player, wrote in a letter to the school that Divilbiss belittled his daughter in front of the team because of her estranged relationship with her father and because of her dyslexia.More than one player said they became so depressed, “it hurt to get out of bed.”“The things they said were so personal, attacking, that they would single you out and you felt you were alone,” Gleason said.Sarah Livingston, who transferred after the 2014 season, said the final straw, for her, was when another coach just turned away after one of Divilbiss’ rants.“That kind of embodied the whole attitude of everyone that wasn’t Divilbiss,” she said.“He wouldn’t stand up for us. He wouldn’t tell coach D to stop. Coach Bollant would be quiet and continue with practice,” Smith said.Thomas, the university’s athletic director, said the university is reevaluating its practice of allowing head coaches to do most of the vetting of assistants they bring in.The university responded by saying that it’s disappointed the lawsuit came before the findings of its internal review and that Thomas has asked staff to closely monitor team activities in the meantime.“I cannot stress enough that anytime we learn that a student feels the experience at Illinois isn’t excellent, we take those concerns seriously. We intended that through the external review process the student-athletes and their families would help us better understand their concerns and perceptions,” Chancellor Phyllis Wise said in a statement.Many players and parents told CNN they won’t be happy as long as Bollant remains. One said, “When you are the head coach, you should stop that when you see it. If you can’t stop bullying amongst your own staff, that is a problem.”Tuck, whose daughter graduated from the program, said the behavior of the coaching staff changed drastically when Bollant was hired after her daughter’s freshman year. And, she said, the attitude of the coaches is drastically different from those of her other daughter, who plays under much better circumstances at Connecticut.Football allegationsThe alleged bullying at the University of Illinois wasn’t isolated to one program or one coach. There are also allegations of wrongdoing in the football program.Recently graduated football player Kenny Knight and three other former players who spoke to CNN say they witnessed two incidents in the past two years in which head coach Tim Beckman was physically rough with players. One player is still on the team and declined through his teammates to talk about what happened. But witnesses said that at the start of one practice, the player ran onto the field with his helmet unbuckled, and Beckman ran over to him, grabbed his face mask and jerked his head back and forth, yelling at him.In 2013, Knight says, a similar thing happened to him. He says Beckman grabbed and tackled him from behind, throwing him to the ground during a practice. Two former teammates who witnessed the incident backed him up.They say it happened after Knight was hit “dirty” by another player with his head down – something that’s prohibited in college football.“I immediately got in his face about it,” Knight said of the player who hit him. “Before I had the chance to lift a finger, in a matter of seconds, I was grabbed by my shoulder and thrown on the ground. I was livid, I thought I was going to look up and see one of my teammates had thrown me down, but I looked up and saw Tim Beckman staring in my face. I was shocked. I don’t think I uttered a word.”The university says Beckman thought he was breaking up a fight; Knight and several other players who witnessed the incident said there was no physical fight happening when Beckman hit Knight. Knight’s father said the night of the incident, Beckman told him, “Kenny accidentally fell backwards over him.”Knight and his father tried to look at the practice tape to review what happened.“There was 35 seconds of blank screen. I could see the dial was moving to let me know that it was still playing, but there was no film to be seen. It wouldn’t play for me or for anybody else,” he said. Two other players said they, separately, also looked for the incident on the practice tape, but it was not there.The university says the “dead time” between plays is not normally recorded during practice. Knight says Beckman called him the day after speaking to his father to apologize, but Knight never reported the incident to anyone at the university out of fear that he’d lose his scholarship. “He should never be allowed to coach again,” Knight said.The National College Players Association is also involved, offering guidance to the players who are coming out publicly and demanding that Illinois fire all coaches involved in physical and verbal abuse.“You can be tough as hell without abusing players,” said NCPA president Ramogi Huma. “Everywhere, coaches yell and cuss. That happens everywhere. What doesn’t happen everywhere is racism,” Huma said, referring to the women’s basketball team. “What doesn’t happen everywhere is forcing players to play through serious injuries. It’s not regular for coaches to put their hands on players – that’s not breaking up a fight, that’s starting a fight,” he said, referring to the alleged incident with the football team.“At the end of the day, it’s about the student-athlete experience, and part of that is their safety, well-being and health,” said Thomas, the university’s athletic director. “And abuse is not acceptable. We hold our staff to a high standard. That line of what’s acceptable and not acceptable is really under the microscope right now.”Brothers allege bullying on football teamKnight and others are speaking up after fellow former teammate Simon Cvijanovic went on Twitter in May to say that he’d been pressured by Beckman to go back on the field too soon after knee surgery and to play through a shoulder injury.Instead, he quit the team, started the hashtag #BanBeckman and inspired several more teammates to speak up, including Knight, and former player Nick North, who told CNN that he, too, was pushed back into practice after hurting a knee ligament.“They kept saying, ‘You need to go back out there,’ even though they knew I wasn’t 100 percent,” North said. “I’d literally be limping while running, and you could see it. … They were like, if you can’t do this, you’re going to have to leave. You can’t play here. We’re going to take your scholarship.” North graduated in December.All the players CNN spoke to said that many more stories like these exist, but players are afraid to speak up because they’re still on the team.“WHEN @coachbeckman is fired you’ll hear plenty more stories but right now he’s dangling scholarships like a carrot,” Cvijanovic tweeted.WHEN @coachbeckman is fired youll hear plenty more stories but right now hes dangling scholarships like a carrot — Simon Cvijanović (@SimonCvijanovic) May 10, 2015He later said, “They act like our bodies are just disposable and we should feel that way also or else we’re not team players. … There’s nowhere to turn to so Twitter is where I went.”He says Beckman threatened to say bad things about his character to National Football League scouts unless he returned to the field after injuries. Once, he says, he was pressured to return two weeks after an ankle injury that his doctor told him needed a six- to eight-week recovery.His younger brother, who also played football but quit the team, struggled as well. A Type 1 diabetic, Peter Cvijanovic had trouble gaining weight and says he was bullied daily by coaches for it.“They made him step on the scale three to five times a day,” Simon Cvijanovic said. “Every time he walked by, coach would make him step up on the scale, and Peter would hang his head and get up on the scale. We were both throwing up in the morning from anxiety – me from my knee and him because of the weight issue.”The university says it cannot discuss the Cvijanovic brothers’ or Nick North’s allegations in detail because of privacy laws.Thomas said he had not been aware of many of the allegations until being asked for comment by CNN, adding that he would ask the firm investigating to expand its scope.“Anytime you receive these types of allegations, it brings you great concern,” he said, later adding, “Here at the University of Illinois, the health and well-being of our student athletes is our number one priority. … Anytime anything rises to a level of a student athlete being mistreated, I would address it immediately.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/07/07/us/illinois-athletics-allegations/index.html"}, {"title": "Government says four cancer charities are shams", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Visitors try out Windows enabled smartphones at the Microsoft stand at the 2013 CeBIT technology trade fair on March 5, 2013 in Hanover, Germany.

And in each instance, none of the four charities would comment. We were ordered out of the building at the Cancer Fund of America in Knoxville, Tennessee, and were the object of an obscene gesture by the CEO of The Breast Cancer Society in Mesa, Arizona.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.The Cancer Fund of America is run by James Reynolds Sr. His son James Reynolds Jr. is the CEO of the Breast Cancer Society. Another charity, the Children’s Cancer Fund of America, is run by Rose Perkins, the ex-wife of the elder James Reynolds. He’s also the CEO of the fourth charity, Cancer Support Services.The government says the charities claimed to provide direct support for cancer patients, breast cancer patients and children with cancer.“These were lies,” the government’s complaint says.Jessica Rich, chief of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, says that in all, the charities spent about 97% of donations they received either on private fundraisers or on themselves. Only 3%, she says, went to help actual cancer patients.According to the complaint, funds donated to help cancer patients instead went for personal use, in often lavish ways.“[D]onated funds were used to pay for vehicles, personal consumer goods, college tuition, gym memberships, Jet Ski outings, dating website subscriptions, luxury cruises, and tickets to concerts and professional sporting events,” the complaint says.“Most of what we are doing is bringing actions against fraud,” says Rich. “And this is as about as bad as it can get: taking money away from cancer victims.”CNN Investigations: Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealingThere was also what the FTC calls “rampant nepotism” at play in all of the charities. For instance, at the Breast Cancer Society, James Reynolds Jr. hired his wife, Kristina Hixson, to be his public relations manager. The complaint states that he also hired Hixson’s two sisters, her son by a previous marriage, her mother and her step-nephew. According to the complaint, Hixson’s mother had been a caterer. At the Breast Cancer Society, she was hired to write grant applications.Moreover,on their tax returns, each charity claimed millions of dollars in donated goods shipped to overseas locations on behalf of cancer patients. The complaint says the charities never owned any of the goods in question and simply paid a fee to a private firm in South Carolina to ship the goods, called gifts-in-kind. CNN went to Guatemala in early 2014 to investigate anyone who may have received those gifts and could find no evidence that they even existed.As a result of the complaint, two of the charities say they will close their doors. Both the Breast Cancer Society and the Children’s Cancer Fund of America are being dissolved, according to the complaint. James Reynolds Jr. faces a judgment of more than $60 million in fines and Rose Perkins, who runs the Children’s Cancer Fund of America, faces a judgment of around $30 million.Under a proposed final order, the judgment against Reynolds Jr. will be suspended when he pays $75,000. The judgments against Children’s Cancer Fund of America will be partly met upon liquidation of its assets, and the judgment against Perkins will be suspended due to her inability to pay.CNN Investigations: Many airport workers not screenedThe FTC’s Jessica Rich, however, said there are few assets left. Government regulators will be lucky to recover $1 million, she told CNN.As for James Reynolds Sr., he will contest the charges in the complaint, the government says. CNN hasn’t yet been able to reach attorneys for Reynolds Sr., his son or Perkins for comment, but in a message posted on the Breast Cancer Society website, Reynolds Jr. said:“While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/05/19/us/scam-charity-investigation/index.html"}, {"title": "Hidden cameras show airport workers stealing from bags", "data_published": "set()", "content": "title: You have to see this!!

The Miami-Dade Police Department set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.“It’s a problem we all face,” said police Lt. Pete Estis. “We will continue to be proactive until we can see that the claims of pilfering through luggage will actually decrease.”Miami Aviation Director Emilio T. González said the insider theft cases “are indeed the exception among the thousands of decent, hardworking employees at MIA, and they have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for their crimes.”And these insider thefts just don’t happen in Miami. A CNN analysis of passenger property loss claims filed with the TSA from 2010 to 2014 shows 30,621 claims of missing valuables, mostly packed in checked luggage. The rest occurred at security checkpoints. Total property loss claimed: $2.5 million.John F.

Prev NextThe problem has been so serious at JFK that in 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera in a baggage hold. The camera showed baggage handlers stealing items on flights bound for Israel, including a $5,000 Seiko watch, iPhones, an iPad, cameras, gold rings and cash. Six of those arrested pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property or petty larceny and the seventh suspect’s case was sealed, according to the Queens District Attorney’s Office.The high-profile case, though, didn’t stop the thefts. Two more baggage handlers at JFK were arrested in 2014 after authorities said they stole two designer handbags from a suitcase, and then tried to sell them on eBay.Then, in December, seven more JFK baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables from checked luggage. The items were stolen from suitcases of passengers traveling to or from Hawaii, Japan, Johannesburg, London, Bangkok, Dubai, Milan and various U.S. cities.In Miami, which aggressively goes after luggage thieves, police have arrested 31 baggage handlers and ramp workers since 2012, including six so far this year.Police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items.Another hidden camera caught a baggage handler rummaging through bags in a secure luggage room inside the airport while a security guard looked the other way.“Insider threat is very scary for us in law enforcement, and certainly someone taking somebody’s cell phone, iPad, computer – what’s next?” Estis said.A CNN investigation earlier this year found that Miami and Orlando are the only two major airports in the country that require employees to be screened through metal detectors. Miami even checks employees when they leave work to go into the main terminal. But that apparently hasn’t stopped the luggage thieves.“As far as being able to get the property off the airfield, that’s a great question,” Estis said. “We have theories.”In Los Angeles, police last year executed search warrants on 25 locations after getting complaints about thefts in two terminals. Among the valuables found were computers, watches, jewelry and cameras and designer bags. Sixteen airport workers were fired.Photos: Items stolen from luggage From LAPD Police in Los Angeles last year executed search warrants on 25 locations after getting complaints about thefts in two terminals at the Los Angeles International Airport.

So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism,” Gannon said.Even the TSA has had problem employees. Since 2002, the agency has fired 513 officers for theft.

The family was exposed to methyl bromide, a restricted-use pesticide. Recovery from their nerve damage has been slow and agonizing for the whole family, but it’s been the worst for the boys. The brothers were in medically induced comas for weeks. They are now conscious, family attorney James Maron said, but they are barely able to move.Six months after the horrifying incident, their father, Steve Esmond, is slowly getting better as well, but suffers from severe tremors, struggles to speak and can’t turn the pages of a book, Maron said.“Neurologically, it’s like being in a torture chamber,” Maron said.Esmond and his boys are mentally “strong as an ox” and “100% cognizant,” but they are trapped in bodies badly damaged by the nerve agent, Maron said.Prior to the incident, the boys were athletic stars at their schools. The older brother had big prospects playing lacrosse and was already touring colleges.Their mother, Teresa Devine, had less exposure to the toxic gas than the rest of the family and has made the strongest recovery, but she spends her days and nights keeping vigil over her boys.What is methyl bromide? Methyl bromide is a restricted-use pesticide that the U.S. EPA has considered \"highly toxic\" for more than two decades. Inhalation of methyl bromide, even short-term, can cause severe lung damage, while long-term inhalation can lead to \"neurological effects.\" Studies on lab animals caused degenerative lesions in the nasal cavity and had effects on the testicles of male animals. Source: EPA“They’re extreme fighters, and that’s why they’re hanging on,” Maron said.The family was on vacation at the Sirenusa resort on St. John when two employees of the local Terminix fumigated the villa below theirs March 18 with methyl bromide, even though it is not approved for residential use. After the family became ill, the Environmental Protection Agency found traces of the lethal gas in their villa.The exposure was so significant inside the treated unit that 6 weeks after the family fell ill, dangerous amounts of methyl bromide were still being detected inside the rental villa, according to EPA documents.Methyl bromide is incredibly toxic to humans, said Dr. Reynold Panettieri Jr., the deputy director for the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology.“I would say the prognosis, at best, is guarded,” said Panettieri, who has not personally treated the family. “As we know the victims have been off ventilators and they’ve been improved. But if that dose, even though it appeared to be acute, was over (a period of) hours, the damage to the nerves and to the brain itself may render it irreversibly damaged.”Delaware boys in critical condition after resort illness, possibly from pesticideMaron said Terminix has agreed to enter mediation, done by Ken Feinberg, who negotiated the settlements for the victims of the September 11 attacks. Mediation begins September 28.What went wrongNew details are emerging about the incident that so drastically sickened the Esmonds. Six others on the islands had mild symptoms of methyl bromide exposure – headache, fatigue, cough and shortness of breath – after the botched March fumigation of the Sirenusa resort. Four of those were emergency workers who helped the Esmond family, according to the EPA.CNN has also learned that the day the pesticide was applied, an exterminator tented and taped off the treated area of the resort villa with 6-millimeter plastic that the gas should not have been able to penetrate.A source familiar with the investigation speculated that the plastic could have come loose, and the chemical perhaps traveled through the air-conditioning system. According to documents received from the EPA in a FOIA request, the EPA also speculated about a gap in the ceiling of the lower unit’s air conditioning unit, speculating that the gas may have traveled to the upper unit. Even so, methyl bromide should not have been used on a residential building in the first place.The pesticide manufacturer, Chemtura, told CNN that an odor is supposed to be added to methyl bromide before any use, much like the artificial odor added to natural gas so that people can detect it. But family attorney Maron said no odor was added in this instance. Terminix will not comment on that part of the investigation.CNN previously reported that methyl bromide was used across the islands on different occasions by Terminix. Other pest control companies on the Virgin Islands were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly. Ken Mapp, the governor of the Virgin Islands, said it was.“What these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law, and they’ll be held accountable for it,” Mapp said. He said he learned his own complex was fumigated with methyl bromide in 2013.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.Methyl bromide is highly restricted because it’s dangerous to the environment. It’s only legal to use for agriculture. But pesticide experts tell CNN it’s very effective on the powderpost beetle, which bores into wood and is prevalent throughout the islands. So even though it’s not legal to use it in residences, some pesticide companies apparently fumigated with it anyway, according to Mapp.Sources tell CNN that there were two Terminix employees on the job at Sirenusa the day the Esmond family was poisoned. One, who was a Terminix salesman, has left the company. His job that day, sources say, was simply to help carry supplies.Pesticide probed in resort illness of Delaware familyEPAJose Rivera, the applicator who used methyl bromide, was the branch manager of the corporate-owned location, and had been in the pest control business for at least a decade. He is on administrative leave. Neither employee has been charged with any crime, and neither would comment to CNN on the case.Workers who fumigate with methyl bromide are supposed to have special training, and they’re supposed to file paperwork with the EPA, detailing how they plan to apply it, every time methyl bromide is purchased.But the key section of those EPA documents was left blank in this case, according to the family’s attorney. The EPA says the forms stay with the distributor, who reports back to the EPA on how much methyl bromide has been sold on a quarterly basis. The EPA says this particular distributor “was not to our knowledge collecting applicator certifications and certainly was not reporting to EPA as a distributor.” The distributor has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.The EPA, Terminix, and the local Department of Planning and Natural Resources all declined to specifically respond to that allegation, citing an ongoing investigation.A pattern of problemsIn the U.S. Virgin Islands, allegations of lax oversight by the Department of Planning and Natural Resources surfaced long before the Esmond family fell ill. The DPNR is the local environmental agency, which receives funding from and is regulated by the EPA.The DPNR has been riddled with corruption for years, and the EPA inspector general recently found deficiencies with the department related to management and oversight in several areas.In May of 2014, the EPA designated it “high risk,” saying the agency “does not meet management standards.”In addition, nearly $100,000 in federal funding that the DPNR received to train local pest control workers did not go toward training. That meant there were no classes whatsoever on the island of St. Thomas, where Terminix is based, according to the former director of the USVI Pesticide Safety Education Program, Joe Williamson.Pesticides dangerous history The EPA has long known of the toxic effects of methyl bromide, and in 2005 banned it except for certain agricultural applications; before the ban took effect, there were several serious incidents involving Terminix. A Pennsylvania woman sued, alleging her 57-year-old son was killed after Terminix fumigated his Lancaster, Pennsylvania, apartment in April 2004. Court papers from the case show that Terminix said it lost the paperwork recording which chemicals were used. Terminix fought the case, saying his death was unrelated, that he had a pre-existing condition, and that no methyl bromide was used. The case settled in 2008. Also in 2006, Terminix pleaded guilty to a criminal assault charge after nine employees in New Jersey were overcome by methyl bromide fumes. The attorney general said Terminix was negligent for not giving the workers proper protective gear or training for removing tarps from stacks of cocoa bean pallets that had been fumigated. Terminix had to pay a $300,000 criminal fine, on top of a $80,000 civil fine.Pesticide applicators are supposed to be retrained every year in order to keep their certification. But because there were no available classes on the island, pest control workers were being recertified without being retrained, Williamson said.That was the case with Rivera, who applied the pesticide at Sirenusa. He was recertified in 2014 without taking additional training – though Williamson says that even if the classes had been available, Rivera would not have been trained to use methyl bromide, because it’s not supposed to be used indoors.The EPA said it was assured by the DPNR that the funds are in the process of being allocated correctly. The EPA also said that Rivera’s certification history is under review by the DPNR.But this is just the latest problem with the DPNR. According to the Department of Justice, three DPNR officials – a former commissioner and two directors – have been sentenced to jail terms since 2008. That year, former Commissioner Dean C. Plaskett was sentenced to nine years for receiving kickbacks in awarding local government contracts.And in 2014, a director pleaded guilty to using his position to engage in illegal drug trafficking while he was head of environmental enforcement at DPNR. He was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison.But Mapp, who took office as governor of the territory in January, told CNN the misuse of methyl bromide had nothing to do with governmental failures but was the result of bad decisions on the part of the pest control companies.“It occurred because someone was cutting corners, thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it. And apparently in my own residence, someone had been getting away with it for quite some time,” Mapp said.Williamson said the EPA bears responsibility as well. “EPA really needs to take the leadership on this, look at the mistakes that have happened here. And the very most important thing for them to do is to quit allowing methyl bromide and these other fumigants to be available to just about anybody with the certification card,” Williamson said. EPA officials tell CNN that they are working on proposals to strengthen training requirements and certifications for people who use methyl bromide.What’s changedSince this incident, the EPA and Terminix have done national inventories, checking for improper methyl bromide use, sources said.The EPA also had a meeting with every region in the nation about the case and sent out a safety alert to all states and territories, asking for “increased vigilance of distribution and use of methyl bromide to ensure the product is not being applied in residential settings.”In a statement, Terminix said: “All of us continue have this family in our thoughts and prayers. We are cooperating with the authorities and conducting our own thorough investigation.”The company also said it has taken steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again, including halting fumigation in the U.S. Virgin Islands, reinforcing policies with employees and speaking to technicians about the specific products they use and how they’re applied.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/09/10/us/virgin-islands-pesticide-investigation/index.html"}, {"title": "It’s not over: Veterans waiting months for appointments", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights Document shows veterans at VAs largest hospital facing months-long waits for appointments Last month, VA official said average wait time was four days Sources say not much has changed despite reaction after last years VA scandalLos Angeles CNN —Thousands of veterans who are patients at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System have been waiting months just for an appointment, CNN has learned.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.What’s more, administrators in charge of the massive VA facility in greater Los Angeles may have been hiding wait times, and may have misled Congress on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care, according to new information obtained by CNN.This revelation means that the scandal over delays in care and wait times for veterans, which embroiled the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs last year and even led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, is apparently not over. And the changes promised by the VA and the Obama administration may not be working.The detailed new evidence comes from the Los Angeles VA’s own internal documents obtained by CNN, and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information.It is particularly significant as the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Medical Center is the nation’s largest VA health care system, caring for hundreds of thousands of U.S. veterans.The VA documents show more than 12,700 appointments, which the VA calls consults, had been waiting more than 90 days to be addressed, as of mid-January.Even new patients seeking care at the Los Angeles VA for the first time can wait months to see a doctor there.Records show on January 15, more than 1,600 veterans who were new patients were waiting 60 to 90 days for appointments. Another 400 veterans have waited up to six months, and 64 veterans had been waiting six months to a year for their appointments.The documents provided to CNN show the lengthy wait times are still happening, within the last several months, and sources say the backlog is happening even now.And yet last month, the VA’s acting director for the Western region overseeing the Los Angeles VA told Congress that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments.“The average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days,” Dr. Skye McDougall, the acting director of the Desert Pacific Healthcare Network, Veterans Health Administration, testified before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.But McDougall’s statement is simply not true.According to the Los Angeles VA’s documents dated January 15, the actual average wait time for new patients at the VA was 48 days. A half-dozen medical and administrative sources inside the LA VA system corroborate these waits.The wait times since then have not changed significantly – coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of March 1, according to another VA document – and are still roughly 10 times what McDougall testified they were.The delays in appointments are even taking place at Los Angeles clinics for mental health, where documents show more than 300 veterans have been waiting more than 30, 60, even 90 days for treatment.At the congressional hearing, McDougall was specifically asked about mental health wait times for new patients, a growing national concern as hundreds of veterans are committing suicide every year.The uncounted: War’s true tollAsked how long the wait time is for mental health at the Los Angeles VA, McDougall testified that the same number – a four days’ wait for new patients – applies for mental health.But that is also not true, according to the documents and sources inside the VA who spoke with CNN.A new LA VA chart shows as of March 1, new mental health patients in Los Angeles are waiting an average 36 days just to get an appointment.Los Angeles VA officials would not talk to CNN about the discrepancies but instead sent a statement saying that the “Greater Los Angeles and VA nationwide continues to work very hard to get Veterans off waiting lists and into clinics to get the care they have earned and deserve.”The VA sent CNN new “retrospective data” showing primary care average wait times of four days, specialty care wait times of 7.5 days, and mental health wait times of 2.5 days, as of January. The VA explained that the chart for new patients obtained by CNN “does not include same day appointments or in some cases same week appointments for those Veterans who need care quickly….”New patients, the VA told CNN, “typically account for less than 10% of all Veteran appointments and are not representative of the whole patient population.”Despite the “retrospective data,” the real truth, say the sources CNN has interviewed, is reflected in the internal LA VA documents obtained by CNN – that wait times for many patients at the Los Angeles VA Medical Centers extends into weeks and months and are a serious problem.This news of continuing delays in Los Angeles comes a year after reports of cover-ups and turmoil at the VA, which became a national scandal, where wait times, veterans’ deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at VA hospitals across the country.Congress even passed a new law last fall to help veterans get care more quickly, as a direct result of the scandal. And since the scandal, Congress has approved $16 billion extra for the VA in an attempt to hire more doctors and nurses and to build more facilities. The VA removed its 14-day scheduling goal to discourage engaging in “inappropriate scheduling practices,” and President Barack Obama also appointed a new VA secretary, Robert McDonald, last summer.Vets not impressed with VA reformsSources in the Greater Los Angeles VA say despite the scandal last year, the new secretary, the new laws and all the attention, not much has changed.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/03/13/us/va-investigation-los-angeles/index.html"}, {"title": "IRS scam costing victims $15 million", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Visitors try out Windows enabled smartphones at the Microsoft stand at the 2013 CeBIT technology trade fair on March 5, 2013 in Hanover, Germany.

They have a Washington phone number and can cite your financial history down to the cent.They say you’re under investigation, in danger of losing your home, or worse, your freedom – unless you pay thousands of dollars on the spot.But they’re not real. And you’re not in trouble. Not unless you take it seriously. This is a scam.CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.A big one. Federal authorities say it’s the largest IRS impersonation scam they’ve ever seen – swindling victims out of more than $15 million since it began in 2013.“They have information that only the Internal Revenue Service would know about you,” said Timothy Camus, deputy inspector general for investigations with the Treasury Department. “It’s a byproduct of today’s society. There’s so much information available on individuals.”Using identity theft technology, the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3,000 people in the past two years, although the Treasury Department cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher. Camus said they’ve recorded more than 366,000 reports of contact with the scammers, and it’s increasing at a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a week.Authorities believe the thieves are operating out of India, using phishing technology to make it appear they’re IRS agents in Washington.The Federal Trade Commission, which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint, and the Treasury Department, which leads the criminal probe, both have open investigations.The largest loss reported was a staggering $500,000, Camus said. Most have lost about $5,000.One of those victims was former NFL player Frank Garcia, who is now a sports radio host in Charlotte, North Carolina. When he got the call, it sounded so authentic, he left the radio station in a panic, scramming to get the money they wanted.12 scams to avoid“The only thing running through my head is, I’m going to jail. I’m gonna be on television, in handcuffs, for tax evasion,” he recalled. “I had to follow specific steps not to be arrested. That the authorities had been contacted and in fact, they are on the way and will be there in 30 minutes.”Garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around Charlotte, depositing $500 each time into a PayPal account set up by the woman on the phone. He ended up losing about $4,000.He, and other victims, told CNN the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone.“I have never been arrested in my life and was very scared,” said Kin Ko, a New Jersey resident who lost about $5,000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison, and the IRS was about to confiscate his assets: His car, his house and all the money in his bank account. The person had a badge number, read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction.The thieves are incredibly smart and convincing. They harness stolen identities and use programs such as Google Earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money.“It sounded as legitimate as could be,” said Al Cadenhead, a pastor in North Carolina who also fell victim. “They knew where I was. He told me where to go – to the Rite Aid, up two streets turn left to the Rite Aid. The names of the streets, it was really just incredible.”Cadenhead told CNN he didn’t come to his senses until he’d signed over $16,000.Identity theft tops list of consumer complaints“It was like I came out of a coma and realized this was not normal and this is not how you do business,” he said. “I know other people who’ve heard the story say ‘How did a guy with a Ph.D. fall victim?’ I was the perfect victim. I’ve never been audited, never paid a traffic ticket. I don’t know how to pay fines. How do I know they aren’t stern and serious about everything?”Camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the IRS, so they do whatever the caller says.In December, federal authorities found and arrested two U.S.-based “runners” who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from pre-paid cards to foreign bank accounts.In many cases, victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations. Ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money.How to get help If you think you have been a victim of an IRS impersonation scam, you can report it to TIGTAs web site or call 800-366-4484.For Frank Garcia, the light came on when the woman on the phone asked him for another $8,000 after he thought his debt had been paid.He says he decided to hang up and await what the woman promised would be an arrest – which, of course, never came.How hackers are stealing your tax refund“I felt taken advantage of. I felt small. And I was naive,” he said. “I wasn’t aware. I didn’t understand the system. And didn’t blame anybody but myself for not taking more time to understand those things.”Often, Camus says, immigrants are targeted and threatened with deportation. The elderly are also a popular target, although the scam has grown so large, people of all ages, income levels and status are getting these calls.Treasury Department officials say if you get one of these calls, the best and simplest way to handle it is to hang up.Camus himself, a Treasury Department investigator, even got one. He told them, “Your time is coming.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2015/03/13/us/irs-scam/index.html"}, {"title": "School fundraising letters signed by fictitious boy", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights St. Josephs Indian School raises over $50 million annually from donations It sends waves of mailings across the country asking for help A Native American leader denounces the tactics, calling them \"poverty porn\" The school admits that the author of a begging letter does not existChamberlain, South Dakota CNN —The boy’s stories are heartbreaking: “My dad drinks and hits me … my mom chose drugs over me … my home on the reservation isn’t a safe place for me to be,” wrote Josh Little Bear. His request seems reasonable – send a few dollars to help St. Joseph’s Indian School to keep “kids like me safe … so we don’t have to live this way anymore.”The story, begging for help, is part of massive national marketing campaign involving 30 million pieces of a mail a year. And it’s a successful one, raising more than $50 million last year.But Josh Little Bear doesn’t exist. It’s not just a pseudonym to protect a child. The story is a fabrication, a compiling of events that may or may not have happened to paint a broad picture that Native American leaders say does not exist.David Ruff/CNN Flags fly at the entrance to St. Josephs Indian School.Officials at St. Joseph’s Indian School – a 200-person boarding school in Chamberlain, South Dakota, that’s affiliated with a Roman Catholic charity based in Wisconsin – say they send out waves of mailings three or four times a year.The latest, a Christmas-oriented mailer, was sent in early November, according to the school’s director of communications.The packets include calendars, personalized return address stickers, notepads, elaborate stickers and a so-called “Dreamcatcher,” a Native American handicraft that by tradition gives its owners good dreams.The Christmas appeal introduced “Emily High Elk.” A year ago when her family brought her to the school, the letter says, “(y)ou could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes.”Now, the letter goes on, “her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed.”David Ruff/CNN Children walk through the school after classes.But again, “Emily High Elk,” is more than a pseudonym. The girl whose life is described in the letter does not exist.According to its financial statements, St. Joseph’s Indian School raised more than $51 million last year from millions of Americans who donated because of those mailings.CNN began receiving complaints about mailings like this more than two years ago. When asked about Josh Little Bear’s letter, Kory Christianson, the director of development, wrote us that there was no such student.“The name ‘Josh Little Bear’ is fictitious,” he wrote, “but unfortunately, his story is not.”The letter, he added, “is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the Native American community, but in families found in every sphere of society.” He said it wasn’t the “intention to disparage in any way the Native American community.”David Ruff/CNN A sculpture of a teepee at St. Josephs Indian School.But some Native Americans say there is deliberate disparagement and that it’s a marketing technique. A half-hour drive away from St. Joseph’s is the Crow Creek Lakota Sioux reservation in central South Dakota, where its vice chairman, Leonard Pease, scoffed at the fundraising letter.“That’s how they get their money,” he told CNN. “To me, they make the Indians look bad.”Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute that aims to strengthen and support Native communities, went further. He termed the fundraising letter and the admission that the child is nonexistent as “poverty porn.”“They are raising money in the name of Indians, using the worst of poverty porn of all Indian country to raise money on all our social ills,” said Roberts, whose Colorado-based group represents six Native American nonprofit organizations.It seems that the money being raised is being used for the right reasons, as far as CNN could see.

The communications director, Jona Ohm, first invited us to meet the school president at the small museum operated by the school.The president, Mike Tyrell, acknowledged that the mailings “push the edge” of marketing and asking about them “is a legitimate question.” But Ohm told us to stop.“You don’t have permission to record in any way, shape or form,” she said.According to its own financial statement for 2013, St. Joseph’s has abundant assets.

A growing number of Haitian refugees, recruited by chicken plants in recent years, have moved to the city, too.The large Catholic church where thousands pray in Spanish every Sunday just paid off its new $1.2 million building, thanks to donations from the congregation.Eateries serving tacos and tamales are easier to find in some parts of the city than restaurants offering grits or fried catfish.The relationships between residents -- and the approaches local leaders take -- have changed.But it doesnt take long to see that tensions are still simmering.Stop by the basketball court where Mexican workers are shooting hoops, and youll hear how afraid they are that Donald Trump might be president , and what it was like a few years back when people couldnt get water or electricity in their homes unless they could prove they were here legally.Sit for a moment in the Little League stands nearby, and a woman flipping through a coupon book as she leans back in a lawn chair will tell you how immigrants should stop speaking Spanish and sucking benefits from the system.Step into a shopping mall off the busy four-lane highway through town, and youll see immigrants searching for the right words in an English class as they talk with their teacher about what foods to eat on American holidays and how fast the cashiers speak at Walmart.Cross the parking lot to visit the unemployment office, and youll hear some people say the influx of immigrants gave the regions economy a boost, while others grumble it cost them their jobs.\"I think they should have to learn to speak like we do,\" says a woman who didnt want to be identified.Theres plenty of jobsLanglois runs her fingers through her hair as she scans the bulletin board at the unemployment office, looking for a lead.Could she be a dishwasher or a welder? Will she go back to working at a chicken plant? Is there any other choice?As an immigrant herself, Langlois says shes had to follow strict rules and make sure her documents are in order when she applies for jobs. And she resents immigrants who came to the United States illegally for finding ways to skirt the system.Programming Note White, Working Class & Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working class Americans and voters. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week.\"Its just not fair,\" she says. \"Its like theyre getting special treatment.\"The CNN/KFF poll found that working-class whites were significantly more likely than other groups to say illegal immigration had directly affected them.More than a quarter (27%) say their family has been negatively affected by undocumented immigrants taking jobs in their community, and among this group, 8 in 10 want the government to deport all undocumented immigrants.The trend is even stronger in the South.Working-class whites in this part of the United States are about twice as likely as those in other regions to say theyve been affected (40% vs. 18% to 22% in other regions).One possible explanation: The South is where demographers say theyve seen the greatest growth in foreign-born and Hispanic populations in recent years.But not everyone thinks immigration in the area hurts a shot at getting a job.\"Theres plenty of jobs. Youve just got to want to do it,\" Ronnie Wise says as he waits for an interview after filling out an application at the unemployment office. \"A lot of people dont want to, and they (immigrants) will. If it werent for them, we wouldnt have any chicken plants here.\"If he meets immigrants who need work, Wise says he knows just what hell do.Help them.Belt buckles inside a display case at an Albertville gift shop show the citys changing demographics.There are so many of usTwo belt buckles sit side by side in a glass display case at a gift shop on Main Street.

An American woman circles the store and ends up at the cash register with an ashtray and a bottle of perfume called Love.As she works the front counter at the Gift on Main/El Regalo, Rachel Zavaleta says its great to see customers from different backgrounds shopping at the store.Times have changed, she says, since the city and state tried to push out immigrants.\"Sometimes, you still get a dirty look when you go somewhere. But they dont do it as much, probably because theyd have to be giving dirty looks all day, since there are so many of us,\" she says.But Trumps campaign is already rekindling friction, she says, in an area where he is heavily favored to win.\"You hear people talk, even your friends or people you know, about getting rid of immigrants.

After a waitress places his plate on the table, he bows his head in prayer.The 59-year-old fence company owner is a lifelong Albertville resident. And he often stops to eat at this family-run restaurant, where a sign hanging by the front door pays tribute to \"Southern living, where the tea is sweet, our words are long, the days are warm and our faith is strong.\"Lately, he says, the topic of immigration has been coming up more often at the breakfast table.Lusk sees the growing presence of immigrants in Albertville as a clash of cultures thats gradually gotten worse.\"Theres no place,\" he says, \"to really be away from them anymore.\"Theres no doubt that most immigrants work hard and mean well, he says.But Lusk sees immigrants as a burden. So do nearly half (47%) of the white, working-class people polled, compared with 20% of white college grads.He says immigrants are draining the school and health care systems, and that some of them have brought crime to the city.Those who came illegally should be sent back, he says, but they probably never will be -- given how much of a financial interest many companies have in keeping them around.\"If they legalize,\" he says, \"well probably have a Hispanic mayor in 10 years.\"The Albertville Museum displays major moments in the citys history, but so far the exhibits havent mentioned immigration.Lets move forwardJust a few blocks from the center of Albertville, a historical marker in front of the citys museum talks about migration. But its referring to people who moved to this mountain town from Georgia and Tennessee in the 1800s.It wasnt until about 30 years ago, museum board member Danny Maltbie says, that immigrants from other countries started trickling in.Maltbie spends a lot of time digging up information about Albertvilles history. Visit the retired automotive plant electrician while hes volunteering at the museum and hell tell you about devastating tornadoes that ripped off roofs and forced the city to rebuild -- twice.Hell tell you that the railroad rumbling through town changed everything, bringing fertilizer for the first time and giving farmers the chance to grow crops in the tough mountain soil. Hell tell you that the arrival of the chicken plants decades ago boosted the economy and eventually brought thousands of immigrants here.And hell tell you how happy he was to give a recent tour of the town cemetery to a class of high school students learning to speak English.\"I thought that was a very good thing that those kids came to see our museum and learn about our history,\" he says.Now, he says, its their history, too.\"Theyre here,\" he says. \"Lets accept them. Lets move forward.\"Local legend has it that signs near the US-Mexico border once informed immigrants that jobs were waiting for them in Albertville. Whether thats how they ended up here, theres no doubt they left their mark on the city once they arrived.The museums volunteer board has debated how to deal with the influx. Inside the one-room museum, there are displays about the towns founder, its Main Street and its small African-American population. But immigration is a topic that hasnt yet been touched on the museums walls.Its a sensitive issue, museum board member Glenda Wooten says, and theyre still trying to sort out the right wording.This month, volunteers added a new entry to the official timeline they hand out to visitors:\"1992: First Hispanics moved to Albertville from Mexico to work in the chicken plants. The children were enrolled in the school system, speaking no English and local administrators and teachers did not speak Spanish. Soon, Albertville City Schools enrollment for Mexicans/Hispanic students was one of the largest in the state.\"About 40% of students at Albertville High School are Hispanic. The principal says diversity prepares kids for the real world.Diversity is a strengthAbout 40% of Albertville High Schools more than 1,300 students are Hispanic, Principal Deidra Robinson says.Students from different backgrounds didnt used to mingle much, she says, but now they stand shoulder to shoulder on the football field and sit together in the cafeteria.\"They just grew up together,\" she says.And even when tension in the community has boiled over, she says, officials worked hard to keep it out of the schools.\"We dont let immigration or the diversity of our school be a barrier to our success,\" she says. \"We see it as part of our success. ... Its helping prepare our students for the real world.\"A majority (60%) of working-class whites in the CNN/KFF poll say increasing diversity is enriching American culture. But 33% view diversity as a threat, and 38% say increasing diversity is harmful because \"some people feel like they no longer belong.\"Robinson says teachers in Albertville make sure everyone has a place.The school system has programs dedicated to helping newcomers who are still learning English, she says, and most immigrants who need the classes are quick learners.Theres one figure Robinson says she frequently mentions to skeptical parents and community members as she fights the misconception that large amounts of school resources are being spent on immigrants.Only about 10% of her students are still learning English, she says.\"When somebody asks a question, they try to make it about color. I just go to turning it around. ... Most of them are actually proficient in both languages,\" she says. \"Thats a comfort to some people.\"I believe in the rule of lawChuck Ellis thinks of the way his 11-year-old daughter, Marli, wakes up in the morning.Shes full of joy when she gets out of bed, he says, knowing things will turn out OK no matter what happens during her school day. But Ellis knows dangers could be lurking.That fear takes hold every time he thinks of the man Marli is named for: his brother-in-law, Marlin Strange, who was shot dead 17 years ago. A Mexican immigrant charged in the slaying is on the FBIs list of most wanted fugitives.Illegal immigration, Ellis says, brought more drugs, crime and prostitution to Albertville. Houses were overrun, with people cramming into buildings and sleeping in shifts.\"It became crazy how many problems we ran into,\" says Ellis, a state trooper who was on the Albertville City Council from 2008 to 2012.\"Im not racist,\" Ellis says. \"I believe in the rule of law.\"While in office, Ellis made fighting illegal immigration a priority. Public safety, he says, was his aim.Its a concern for many Americans when they talk about immigration. About half (49%) of white working-class Americans think Latin American immigrants increase crime in communities, according to the CNN/KFF poll. Thats higher than other groups polled; among white college grads the number is 32%.Along with the citys then-mayor, Ellis supported ordinances that made English the official language, booted taco trucks from operating on Main Street, limited the number of people who could live inside a home and ordered store signs to include English translations.And he invited someone to Albertville to help the city take more substantive measures: Kris Kobach, a prominent conservative attorney who made a name for himself helping governments across the country craft laws to crack down on illegal immigration.In the end, the city decided not to hire Kobach. But Alabama legislators did; he was one of the primary architects of the states immigration law. And Ellis is proud of inviting him to Albertville. He still has a copy of a newspaper front page that shows him shaking Kobachs hand.Ellis isnt on the City Council anymore; he lost his bid for re-election in 2012. But hes considering another run for county sheriff (he lost his bid to unseat the incumbent in 2014). Rounding up millions of immigrants who entered the United States illegally and deporting them isnt feasible, he says. But more needs to be known about whos already here.\"The big thing is the vetting process, making sure that people have done the right things, that people dont have illnesses, that people arent bad people,\" he says, \"because weve got enough bad people in the country without letting in more.\"Freddy and Nancy Salazar relax at home with son Aydan, 2. \"There is no racism between children,\" Freddy Salazar says.Im not stealing anyones jobNancy Salazar says shell never shake how it felt to live in Albertville when city and state leaders took aim at illegal immigration. Even though she was born in the United States, Salazar says she felt the glaring heat of racism then. And sometimes, she still does.Hard-working immigrants are the bedrock of Albertvilles economy, she says, and its unfair to blame them for crime in the city or anywhere else.\"We are not what they think,\" she says. \"They are just outraged Hispanics have something.\"In English, Salazar speaks with the smooth lilt of a Southern belle. And in Spanish, her words slice through the air with the sharp precision of a native speaker.The 30-year-old preschool teacher, who was born in Florida to parents who immigrated to the United States from Mexico, sees the importance of keeping traditions alive.On the wall of her living room, her high school senior picture shows her wearing the silver dangly earrings shed put on for cheerleading practice; shes still embarrassed she forgot to wear pearls that day.Nearby, she keeps a large Virgin of Guadalupe figure standing next to a big-screen TV.Her husband, Freddy, who was born in Mexico, says hes worked hard in difficult conditions to become a supervisor at a nearby poultry plant. His fingers are so swollen from his years on the job that he struggled to get a ring on his finger when the couple recently renewed their marriage vows.\"The racists are the ones who dont know the work that we do. They judge without knowing. ... Theres never going to be an American doing the work I do. Im not stealing anyones job,\" he says. \"There simply is work.\"Fruits and veggies are plentiful at the Albertville Farmers Market. One vendor says immigrants work hard harvesting crops.An invaluable resourceMonte Weldon walks over to a giant Scrabble board on the ground just a few steps from her stall at the Albertville Farmers Market and spells out T-O-M-A-T-O.Its one of many crops Americans wouldnt have a chance to enjoy, she says, without immigrant labor.\"They get a bad rap, but you know what, a lot of people would go hungry if they werent there,\" she says. \"Theyre an invaluable resource.\"As she sells tomatoes, okra and black-eyed peas, Weldon says she usually tries to steer clear of arguments over immigration. Its one of those issues where people never seem willing to listen or change their minds.Instead, she focuses on her children.\"I taught my kids to understand about different people, different ways to believe. I raised my children in church,\" she said. \"Were not God. Its not our place to judge.\"The color of your skin doesnt matter, she says, and everyones blood is red.Were a community\"How are we all going to live together here?\"Thats the question the exasperated publisher of a local newspaper asked back in 2009 at a town meeting as residents and local leaders sparred over immigration.Back then, it seemed like the fury might never die down.Now, while national debate over immigration rages, many in this city have settled for a reluctant truce. Some hope theyll have another shot at getting their way. And others wonder if theyre experiencing the uneasy calm that comes before a storm they wont be able to stop.Lindsey Lyons led Albertvilles efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and trumpeted the states law on national media. As mayor, he kept a US Border Patrol baseball cap on display in his City Hall office.Lyons, who lost his post in 2012, declined to comment for this story. When he spoke with CNN in 2011 , he said he had run for office because he was tired of the DUIs, drug trafficking and gang activity that he saw immigrants bringing to Albertville.\"We have a right and moral responsibility,\" he said, \"to protect our citizens and our quality of life.\"Tracy Honea, who ousted Lyons and just won re-election, says when it comes to immigration, hes doing his best to play the hand he was dealt.\"I truly believe folks need to be legal,\" he says, \"but its out of our control on a national level.\"Honea says he tries to take a positive approach as mayor.\"Weve worked really hard at trying to create an atmosphere that were a community, and its a growing community,\" he says.On his office wall, Honea keeps a framed photo of Ronald Reagan riding a white horse that he was thrilled to win at a silent auction. Beneath the photo is a quote from the former US Presidents 1985 State of the Union address:\"Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of all Gods children.\"Earlier this year, a class of high school students learning English visited City Hall.Honea fielded questions from them inside the City Councils chambers.

Both live in North Carolina. Both think America’s best days are ahead of it.But their shared optimism stems from sharply different assessments of the country’s current state of affairs. Bryant, a retired nurse who says she lives comfortably in New Bern, North Carolina, sees an improving economy, neighbors whose children are purchasing their first homes and general prosperity. She also says she will probably vote for Hillary Clinton.“I see improvement in people’s wages,” said Bryant, who declined to give her age except to say that she is a senior citizen.“The way they dress. When I go to the grocery store, I see people with big baskets of food. People look like they’re doing well. I just think that things are better all the way around.”For her part, Gibson, 63, sees a country overrun by immigrants and refugees with alien values, living on the dole, taking jobs and benefits away from native-born Americans.She says political leaders in Washington are out of touch with the concerns of people like her and that her optimism for the future is based on her belief that Donald Trump will win the presidency.“Right now everything is in one hell of a mess, and I believe that Trump is going to come in and clean things up,” she said.Far from a monolithThe white working class, which forms the core of Trump’s support, is often treated as a monolithic entity, both in its beliefs and its images. But an extensive survey of whites with less than a four-year college degree conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation paints a picture of an often-ignored demographic that belies the stereotypic images of Midwestern steel workers toting lunch pails to work, or golden-hearted cashiers working at Walmart or laid-off coal miners in Appalachia sitting around, chugging beer and seething in resentment.What the poll discovered is that, as much as the white working class differs in attitudes and experience from college-educated whites and from working-class blacks and Hispanics, it presents an intriguing mosaic within its demographic group.Far from being monolithic, the white working class has sharp divisions based on age, geography, income, gender and religion. These differences show up in their views towards immigration and racial and ethnic diversity; optimism about the direction of their lives and their children’s future; their opinion about government or their support for Donald Trump.“We went into this poll trying to keep an open mind and not look at the white working class as a monolithic group,” said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation.For example, urban-dwelling members of the white working class are more optimistic about America’s future than their counterparts in rural areas. Almost three-quarters of working-class whites younger than 30 who were surveyed believe increasing racial and ethnic diversity is enriching the country’s culture, while about half of those older than 65 who were surveyed do.Southern whites who have not attended college are twice as likely as those in other regions to say they have been negatively impacted by undocumented immigrants taking jobs in their community.Southern working-class whites are the most pessimistic about the country’s future. Only 37% of working-class whites in the South who were surveyed believe the country’s “best days are ahead of us,” compared to nearly half those in the West and 52% in the Northeast. Evangelical Christians and those living in rural areas tend to be the most downcast about the future.About 60% of working-class whites surveyed who say they are evangelical Christians say the country’s best days are behind us, compared to 42% of Catholics, 53% of mainline Protestants and 42% who say they have no religion.Similarly, 41% of those surveyed living in urban areas say America’s best days are behind us, while nearly 60% of those in rural areas feel that way.Wanting more from the governmentDifferences also show up strongly with regard to the anger that the white working class feels toward government. The survey found 69% of those earning less than $30,000 say the federal government is not doing enough to help them and people like them. That’s more than twice the 31% of those earning $75,000 or more who feel that way.“You can go back the last 50 years and it’s always the same,” says Tim Bequette, 56, a retired truck driver who lives on disability in Farmington, Missouri. “Politicians make all kinds of promises. But when they get elected they only pay attention to people who have money. If you’ve got money, you can get what you want. If you don’t have money, nothing happens.”Ironically, or perhaps due to the fact that their incomes are lower, a larger percentage of people, 63%, who receive at least one government benefit, excluding Social Security and Medicare, say the government isn’t doing enough for them. That’s compared to the 47% who feel that way even though they receive no government aid.Fully 71% of rural working-class whites blame the government for economic problems facing the working class, compared to 51% of working-class whites who live in cities. Rage at the government is felt most acutely by older white working-class men. Nearly 80% of the men over than age of 50 who were surveyed say the government bares all or most of the blame for the problems facing the white working class. About 53% of women in that age group who were polled agree.But despite the anger expressed toward the government and the pessimism about the country’s future, majorities of working-class whites surveyed – regardless of age, income, region, religion and gender – say they are satisfied with their personal financial situation.Related: The economy stinks but I’m OK“I’m pretty happy overall with the place that I am,” said Amanda, 28, who lives in Overton, Texas, and only wants to be identified by her first name. “I have a low mortgage. My kids are going to good schools. My job is relatively stable.”Chad Fritz, 42, says he is not concerned about immigrants. “Trade deals concern me more,” he says. “I’m more concerned about losing jobs than people taking jobs, which is what many people say immigrants do. But I feel the jobs they’re taking are jobs Americans don’t really want to do. I don’t want to go pick apples and oranges, and those are the type of jobs immigrants are doing.”Fritz lives in Delaware, Ohio. He is a stay-at-home dad, taking care of his one-year-old son during the week while his wife works as a CPA in nearby Columbus. On many weekends he works as a glass blower.The Columbus metro area is an economic powerhouse with low unemployment, rising home prices and high median incomes. Fritz acknowledges that the strength of the local economy influences his attitude.“Columbus is a growing city,” he said. “It’s booming. It’s doing very well. There are lots of jobs. I might have a different view if I lived somewhere else.”The politics of the white working classWhile support for Trump is relatively strong across the board among working-class whites, there are significant differences among different groups.Men over the age of 50 are among the Republican nominee’s strongest backers with 68% of voters in this group saying they would consider voting for him, compared to 51% of women who are 50 years or older.Rural (68%), suburban (66%) and Southern (70%) working-class white voters voice support for Trump in larger numbers than urban dwellers (49%) and those living in the West (54%) and Midwest (53%). And 78% of working-class white voters surveyed who say immigrants are a burden on the country say they would consider voting for him, compared to 38% who of those who believe immigrants strengthen the country.Amanda, of Overton, Texas, and Ann Bryant say they are supporting Clinton. Bequette and Jennifer Gibson back Trump. Chad Fritz is undecided, but doesn’t like either Trump or Clinton. He is trying to decide between Green Party nominee Jill Stein and the Libertarian candidate (Gary Johnson), whose name he couldn’t remember.Working-class whites are clearly more hostile to immigration and the nation’s increasing racial and ethnic diversity.Respondents were asked which comes closer to their view: that immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents, or immigrants are a burden on the country because they take our jobs, housing and health care. Nearly half (47%) of those surveyed say it’s the latter.More than half (55%) say they think the government should try to deport all people living in the country illegally.Also, compared to college-educated whites or black or Hispanic working-class people, working-class whites are more likely to say immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks or that recent immigrants from Latin America take jobs away from Americans or add to the crime problem.Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Photos: CNN/KFF Poll Results on Immigration Prev Next“Obama agreed to let all them refugees come in and give them a place to live,” said Bequette, the retired truck driver. “Yet you see hundreds of thousands of Vietnam vets living on the streets. The politicians are more worried about being politically correct and about what other countries think about us than they do Americans.”But that hostility is not shared equally across the board.Sixty-one percent of rural white working-class surveyed say the government should try to deport all those in the country illegally, compared to 49% of urban dwellers.Moreover, compared to other religions, evangelical Christians are more likely to say that increasing diversity is threatening, rather than enriching American culture; believe that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorism, add to the crime problem, and take jobs away from Americans; and are less likely to say that these immigrants are “basically good, honest people.”“Half the people coming in are young men,” Gibson, who describes herself as Pentecostal, says of Muslim refugees. “I feel sorry for the women and children. We need to make a place for them over there. The guys? I don’t feel sorry for them at all. They need to turn their asses around and pick up a gun and fight for their country. Our guys are fighting for their country. They should too, instead of running over here.”Fritz, who says he has no problems with immigrants, says he was raised Catholic but hasn’t been to church in 20 years. “I’m not a church-type person,” he says. “But, from a sense of morals, I like to think I have Christian values.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/09/25/politics/white-working-class-overview-kff-poll/index.html"}, {"title": "2016: Last call for working class whites?", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights About 6 in 10 white working class people say its gotten harder for people like them to get ahead For nearly all of American history, whites without college degrees made up a majority of votersWashington CNN —The biggest story of the 2016 election is undoubtedly the rise of Donald Trump, and behind the Republican nominee is a group in its last throes as the biggest force in politics: The white working class.A new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation delves deeply into this pivotal group, to understand their experience in an America whose changing demographics and economy have arguably impacted this group more than almost any other.Contrary to many assumptions about this group, the poll finds working class whites generally happy with their lives, and mostly satisfied with their personal financial situation. Just 18% say they are angry about the way things are going in their own lives, and 44% think America’s best days lie ahead. They are just as likely as their black and Hispanic working class counterparts to feel optimistic about their lives, 7 in 10 or more say so in each group.But the white working class harbors deep concerns about the country’s economy, the amount the government is doing to help the working class and their own ability to influence politics.A majority, 53%, say they are very dissatisfied with the country’s economic situation and 84% say their views are not well represented by the government in Washington, well above the share of white college graduates or black or Hispanic working class to say the same.About 6 in 10 white working class people say it’s gotten harder for people like them to get ahead financially and two-thirds say it’s harder to find good jobs. Many are concerned about what the next generation will face: 50% say they expect their children to have a lower standard of living than they currently have, compared with 35% among whites who have college degrees, 43% among the black working class and 31% among the Hispanic working class.More than other groups, whites without college degrees blame the government for the economic problems that beset the working class, with 62% saying the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for those problems compared with less than half among whites with degrees and the black and Hispanic working class, and 66% saying it doesn’t do enough to help the working class.Amid these concerns, Trump holds broad appeal among white working class voters. Sixty percent say they would consider Trump this fall, about double the 29% who say they’d consider Hillary Clinton. Among other groups, far fewer even say they would consider Trump. Among whites with college degrees, 39% say they’d consider him – that’s cut in half among Hispanic working class voters, 18% of whom say they’d consider Trump, and just 3% of black working class voters say they’ll give Trump a look.White working class voters are more Republican than Democratic, 56% in the CNN/KFF poll are Republicans or independents who lean that way, compared with 33% who consider themselves Democrats or are independents who lean that way, but the poll reveals that their views on what the government does to help people like them and the changing demographics of the country – two issues that have been a central focus of Trump’s campaign – are driven by both education and partisanship.The undeniable trendFor nearly all of American history, whites without college degrees – the group identified as white working class for the purposes of this survey and in many assessments of the American electorate – made up a majority of the public and a majority of voters.That has changed, and rapidly, at the same time the nation’s economy has shifted to favor those who hold college degrees. Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 by an electorate in which 63% of voters were whites who had not completed a four-year college education, according to exit polls. That had dropped 10 points by 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency. That election marked the last time exit polls would find whites without college degrees to be a majority of voters. By the time Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, just 39% of those who cast ballots were whites without degrees.Census figures for voting and registration suggest that the white working class make up a larger share of the electorate than do the exit polls, roughly 44% in 2012 in that estimate. Both data sources have different and unquantifiable sources of error, and there has been some dispute over their true share of the electorate. Regardless of the data source, however, the trend is the same and undeniable – the white working class is shrinking, and at the same time, their ability to influence American politics has declined.Enter Trump.Working class white voters have been critical to Trump’s success. Throughout the Republican primaries, Trump’s victories were bolstered by support from whites without degrees. Across 28 states with exit or entrance polls this spring, Trump averaged 50% support among white non-college GOP primary voters or caucus participants, compared with 37% among whites with college degrees.And across five CNN/ORC polls conducted since the primaries ended in June, Trump’s lead among white non-college voters averages 29 points, while white college voters have broken in Clinton’s direction by an average of 8 points.Restated in terms similar to the oft-cited gender gap, that adds up to a 37-point education gap among whites. According to exit polls back to 1980, it has never been larger than 14 points.The white working class shifts RepublicanDemocrats used to be the party of the white working class, and Republicans, the party of the college educated. Those roles have flipped.Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director for strategic partnerships at Atlantic Media who has reported extensively on this group, calls it class inversion.“In the 50s, 60s, and 70s, Democrats ran better among non-college than college whites,” he said. “Starting in the 80s, the two lines converged, and in 2000, (Al) Gore ran better among college than non-college whites, (John) Kerry ran 6 points better, Obama 7 points.”Some of that is due to the shifting economy. Working class whites were largely synonymous with union members, who are traditionally staunchly Democratic. As the service economy has grown and manufacturing declined, the profile of union members has changed. In 1980, 70% of all voters who came from union households were whites without college degrees; in 2012, the white working class made up just were 39% of voters from union households. Non-whites and white college graduates were each about 30% of the union vote in 2012, almost double their share of the 1980 vote, and those two groups are increasingly Democratic.But some of it is their differing views on government and change in American society. Within the white working class, those who consider themselves Democrats and those who say they are Republican tend to agree in their assessment of how the working class is doing. About 7 in 10 working class white voters in each party say it’s gotten harder for people like them to find good jobs, and narrow majorities of both say the government isn’t doing enough to help “people like you.”And while they don’t see exactly eye-to-eye on immigration or the increasing diversity of the United States, both sets of partisans are more apt than their college-educated counterparts to see a negative side to the country’s shifting demographics. Both working class white Democrats and Republicans are more likely than white college educated partisans to feel that the country’s increasing racial and ethnic diversity is harmful because it leaves some people feeling left behind. The same pattern emerges in perceptions of immigrants, with white non-college partisans more apt than white partisans with degrees to say immigrants today are a burden on the United States and that the government should attempt to deport all immigrants currently living in the US illegally.And in a party whose second-place finisher for this year’s presidential nomination considers himself a socialist, working-class white Democrats are less apt than their college-educated counterparts to consider themselves liberal or to be non-religious, two factors that could be driving them away from the Obama-era Democratic Party.Among white working class Democrats who are registered to vote, 22% say they would consider voting for Trump, vs. just 2% among white Democrats with college degrees, and nearly a quarter, 23%, say they will definitely not vote for Clinton, a figure that stands at 3% among white Democrats with college degrees.The effects of this shift are showing in recent swing-state polling. Trump’s best chance to win the presidency comes by flipping rust-belt states where Democrats have had natural advantages in recent presidential elections and which have larger than average blocs of white non-college voters – Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin among them. In each, Trump has cut into Clinton’s advantage with broad support from the white working class.In the pure battlegrounds, Ohio and Iowa also appear to be shifting Trump’s way on the strength of his support among white non-college voters.“Democrats have run slightly better among blue-collar whites in Midwestern swing states, and that has been a key to them holding those states,” said Brownstein.Will they vote?Majorities of voters across partisan, education, and racial lines say they are dissatisfied with the influence that people like them have on the political process. But there are broader differences when asked about the likelihood of actually turning out to impact that process.In the CNN/KFF Poll, 71% of white non-college voters said they always vote in presidential elections, and 79% rated the chances that they would vote a 10 out of 10. But both figures were smaller than among whites who do have college degrees, about 9 in 10 in that group said they always vote and would be very likely to this time around.But a CNN/ORC poll in early September found almost no difference between whites with degrees and those without in terms of enthusiasm about voting this year. Forty-two percent of white college graduates were extremely or very enthusiastic, as were 43% of white non-college registered voters.Should turnout levels among whites without degrees, whites with degrees and non-whites continue along their current trajectory, the white working class would likely emerge from 2016 still the largest voting bloc in the country in terms of race and educational attainment, for what may be the last time.The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites – white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school.Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the Hispanic working class.

Rather, they agree with him that America is not as great as it once was, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll.While black evangelicals are solidly against the GOP nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four – 76% – say they’d consider voting for Trump.Partisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans.The majority – 6 in 10 – of voters in this group believe the US’ better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less Christian. Nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today.While most Christian groups – 73% of mainline Protestants and 61% of Catholics – share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack.Trump often says he wants to “make America great again,” and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn’t mean they don’t question the faith of a man who once said he never asks God for forgiveness.“When listening to him, he’s not a Christian. He does not have any of the values that we have,” said Buddy Mitchell, a 47-year-old from Arvada, Colorado, and owner of a flooring company.“I don’t know of any redeeming quality of Donald Trump other than both Democrats and Republicans hate him,” said Mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. “That’s the only reason I like him: that the establishment doesn’t like him.”Christian values seen as under attackThat dislike for the establishment is a strong point for Trump with this demographic. For many white working-class evangelicals, it’s clear who is at fault for many of the country’s issues: the federal government. White working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class.“I don’t think that either candidate is taking Christian values into consideration,” said Sandra Long, an 80-year-old lifelong Democrat. “Neither one of them is acting very Christian-like. Just a lot of things are said and done. It scares me.”Long, a Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, resident, is scared that society is becoming more secular and will be a less accepting place for people with more conservative Christian values.“I feel the country was founded on Christian principles. They came here to get away form being persecuted for their beliefs,” she said. “And now, if our ministers don’t marry a gay couple or refuse to marry a gay couple, they can be arrested and taken to jail.”While same-sex marriage is legal, religious leaders are not required to marry gay couples.Darrell Pool, a 60-year-old from Lamar, Colorado, said he doesn’t see his traditional Christian values honored by the leading candidates.“I don’t see my values shaping the election. There’s just a lot of mayhem,” he said. “I think the values that were in the country’s founding are leaving. The moral values are leaving daily.”Many white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory.“I don’t know where I am,” said Long. “I’m so confused at this point and time. I don’t believe either one of them should be in office. I don’t believe either one should be running.”Some have entertained third-party candidates.“I’m sick to my stomach. I cannot stand Hillary (Clinton) and I can’t stand Trump, so for the first time in my life, I’m thinking of voting Libertarian or not voting,” Mitchell said.For these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of Clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years.“If you or I would have done what she did with those emails, we’d be in jail,” Mitchell said. “But because she’s the Democratic nominee, they don’t hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people.”Many of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the Christian faith.Security also a concernBut values aren’t the only concerns of these voters. National security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military.“All these refugees they want to bring in, that’s really got me going,” said Pool, who participated in the survey. “They have no idea who they’re bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here.”“I just think it’s ludicrous and all it’s for is so one party can have more voters,” he said.The relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. Some of the biggest critics of Trump’s proposed Muslim ban have been evangelicals. Christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn’t mean some among their flock aren’t anxious.The majority – 75% – of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US, a higher percentage than other working-class whites.“I say let’s quit bringing these people in, period,” Pool said. “I realize America is a melting pot and that’s how America started in the first place, but we have a process here. Nobody says you can’t come to this country. Come on in. Let’s do it the right way.”", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/09/24/politics/white-working-class-evangelicals/index.html"}, {"title": "The shell-shocked white working class (Opinion)", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights Problems bothering white Americans without a college degree have less to do with immediate economic insecurity than with the collapse of a whole way of life, writes Stephanie Coontz Its been 40 years in the making, she writesEditor’s Note: Stephanie Coontz teaches history at Evergreen State College and wrote the newly revised, “The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap.” The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.CNN —The problems bothering white Americans without a college degree have less to do with immediate economic insecurity or material hardship, although those are widespread, than with the collapse of a whole way of life.Following World War II, production workers experienced three decades of unprecedented economic and social gains. But since the end of the 1970s, they have seen a nearly unremitting decline in their real wages, working conditions and social status, along with a loss of the interpersonal and work networks that were once the basis of their upward progress and their entire community’s stability.I think it’s fair to say that large segments of the white working-class are feeling shell-shocked.One pastor who has ministered to a congregation of whites in post-industrial central Philadelphia and to a rural congregation in Wisconsin said this of his parishioners: “Every time something changed in their lives, it changed for the worse. And I mean just about every stinking time.”The rise and fall of stability in working-class life explains much that otherwise seems puzzling in the responses to this week’s CNN-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. We’ve heard much about working-class anger. Yet the poll reveals a rather uncomplaining acceptance of what is, in many cases, a far from an easy life.Sixty-three percent of white working-class respondents say they are “very” or “somewhat” satisfied with their personal financial situation, even though in the past year 46% of them say they postponed medical or dental care and half took an extra job or added work hours to make ends meet. About 30% of those who are employed face the stress of work shifts that change every week. But 76% say they are optimistic about what’s going on in their personal life, and 77% of those who are working believe their jobs are secure.However, this willingness to see the upside of difficult living conditions coexists with a deep pessimism about the future, and especially their children’s future. Fully half of working-class whites expect their children’s lives will be worse than their own. Fewer than one-quarter expect their children to do better.Working-class blacks and Hispanics are far more optimistic than their white counterparts, even though the unemployment rate of blacks without a college degree is twice as high as that of whites, as is the percentage of black workers who are working part time although they want full-time jobs.On average, blacks and Hispanics have lower incomes and are less likely to own their homes. They lost more ground than whites during the recession and have regained less ground since. Yet 36% of working-class blacks and 48% of working-class Hispanics believe their children will do better than they.Another striking difference is that only 45% of whites without a college education, compared to almost 75% of blacks and Hispanics, say their life would be better if they had a four-year college degree. Fifty-one percent of the whites think it would make no difference, and 3% feel it would have made things worse.These attitudes stem from the tremendous leap forward that white working-class Americans made in the 1950s and 1960s. People who study race relations in America often talk about white privilege, but this is a relative concept when it comes to the working class. For 200 years, elites had encouraged a sense of white superiority to defuse class resentments and head off interracial class alliances. But as in so many conflicts, the foot soldiers of white dominance seldom got a very large share of the spoils.Low-income whites were given preference over minorities in hiring, wages, and promotions (except during strikes, when employers were quick to replace strikers with minorities whom they fired afterward, reinforcing hostility on both sides).Yet their relative advantages over workers of other races did not produce a life of privilege for white production workers, who earned low wages with few benefits, faced frequent layoffs and suffered high rates of on-the-job injuries.Mark Makela/Getty Images A coal miners boot remains inside the St. Nicholas Coal Breaker in Manahoy City, Pennsylvania.Life got betterIn the decades after World War II, though, life got much better for white male workers and their families. The tremendous growth of unions, along with new government regulations, put a stop to some of the exploitative practices of employers. Meanwhile, from 1950 to 1979, government invested in infrastructure and new technologies at almost twice the rate since 1980, creating rapid blue-collar job growth.For the first time, the American Dream came within reach for white blue-collar workers– a dream not of immense wealth but of the ability to sustain a comfortable family life by working hard and well at your job. Between 1947 and 1973, the real wages of the average young male worker without a college education doubled as he moved from age 25 to 35. In 1959, the average 30-year-old man could pay the mortgage on a median-priced home using only 18% of his gross monthly pay.And his wages continued to rise through his working life as new seniority laws prevented aging workers from being displaced or demoted. A man passing from age 40 to 50 saw his earnings increase by another 30 percent.For the first time, the American Dream came within reach for white blue-collar workers– a dream not of immense wealth but of the ability to sustain a comfortable family life by working hard and well at your job. Stephanie CoontzPerhaps more important psychologically was that young people in that era could see that they were doing much better than their parents. In 1961, men aged 25 to 29 were, on average, earning four times more in real wages than their fathers at about the same age.A different kind of successThe basis of success in working-class communities was very different from how success is gained by today’s mobile professionals. Working-class neighborhoods clustered around sources of employment, within walking distance from the small businesses that depended on them for customers, and often within sight of the homes of the managers who supervised them.There was suspicion of strangers, and racial segregation was the norm, but there was less separation by class and income than today. Their bosses often frequented the same churches. Educated professionals had enough close contact with workers to respect the skill and stamina involved in what economists now call “routine” or “semi-skilled” labor.At churches, work, and schools, people were enmeshed in stable personal networks that were far from egalitarian but were often the main way young men found a job and small businesses built their base. If you worked hard, respected your place in the social hierarchy, and conformed to community standards, you could expect to get a decent job, have the satisfaction of doing better than your own parents, and see your own kids do better than you.Coming out of this tradition, it’s no wonder that half of these individuals don’t think having a four-year degree would have helped them. Their frame of reference is a world where you didn’t need to go to college to do better than your father. It often made more sense to simply follow in his footsteps.The erosion of such communities and workplaces has been going on for almost 40 years. Many manufacturing jobs have been lost or outsourced. Most that are still around or have come back now pay lower wages and provide fewer benefits. Between 1947 and 1979, for example, real wages of meatpacking workers increased by an average of 80 percent (to just under $40,000 per year in constant dollars). But from 1979 to 2012, those wages declined by 30%, to about $27,000 a year.The old social contract – and the old social contacts – have, for good and for ill, ceased to organize work and community life.For the past three decades, the average young man without a college degree has consistently done worse than his father. Between 1979 and 2007, young men with a high school degree suffered, on average, a 29% decline in real earnings.Humans see things in relative terms. When we assess our present position and prospects, we do so in relation to our past experiences and expectations. Most white working-class Americans are still better off than most black and Hispanic non-college-educated workers, but they have been on a long, demoralizing downward slope. By contrast, although blacks and Hispanics started from a much lower base, they have seen remarkable progress since the early 1960s, despite suffering more than whites during recessions.For the past three decades, the average young man without a college degree has consistently done worse than his father. Stephanie CoontzIt is not surprising that so many white workers are pessimistic about their future. Even if their changes for the worse leave them better off than many of their black and Hispanic counterparts, people usually focus more on what they’ve lost rather than on the narrowing edge they may retain over others.Why not go to college?But why, many ask, aren’t lower-income white men flocking to college? It’s more complicated than lack of initiative. Ironically, one thing that now holds white working-class men back is the residue of their traditional race and gender bonus: Men who drop out of college initially earn, on average, as much as men who have recently completed their degree.The college advantage multiplies over time, but it’s tempting – although self-defeating in the long run – to start earning as much as Joe the new college grad without foregoing earnings for several years or taking on debt.Furthermore, going to college can be risky for people whose parents can’t offer substantial support. Older Americans who brag of working their way through college may not realize that between 1975 and 2015, tuition and fees grew by more than 200% at community colleges and at private, nonprofit, four-year colleges and universities – after accounting for inflation. At public four-year colleges and universities, they grew by nearly 300%.In 1979, the average student at a four-year university could pay for tuition by working just 182 hours per year. By 2013, the average student had to work 991 hours. And unlike the early 1970s, most available aid takes the form of loans rather than outright grants.A recent study of 3,000 young adults who entered public four-year institutions in Wisconsin found that even with the help of Pell grants, college was still unaffordable. Only half the students received any credential within six years, a long time to put earnings on hold. Almost 40% dropped out, many saddled with debt that put them further behind than when they started.Even getting a degree does not guarantee getting a job that allows you to pay off debts. Since 2000, employment of college grads has grown more rapidly in low-earning than high-earning jobs.Many liberal politicians have failed to acknowledge those realities, and many conservatives have manipulated them to fan racial resentments. It’s not just Trump who’s been stirring the pot. Racial fears have been whipped up for years by the same politicians who now piously denounce them. Think Reagan’s Welfare Queen, George H. Bush’s Willie Horton, Jeb Bush’s “free stuff” remarks, and the Clintons’ “Super-predators.”Racism is not the only reason for Trump’s popularity. A significant number of Trump supporters say they voted for Obama in 2012, and so far Obama seems to have done better with white working-class voters in Florida, Ohio, and Iowa than Clinton is currently doing.Blaming it on raceBut the legacy of racism runs deep, especially in the old Confederacy. And in the absence of a clear acknowledgement of how and why white working-class men and communities have suffered and without any firm commitment to turn that around, many whites have been persuaded to blame their declining fortunes on blacks and immigrants.In the 1950s, race outweighed education in determining wage rates. On average, white men with only a high school degree out-earned blacks with a college degree. Today, education outweighs race. But many working-class whites don’t yet realize that this is not a result of reversed racial preferences but of new market preferences:Studies confirm that employers still favor white men over blacks in most labor markets where applicants have equal education. When nearly identical résumés are sent out, for example, the candidate with a white-sounding name receives more callbacks than the applicant with a black-sounding name.Some whites look at the gains of black professionals, formerly held back by legally enforced discrimination, and say that “those people” are taking a job that could be theirs. Yet if educated minorities weren’t in the picture, it would be OTHER white people, from more privileged families, taking those jobs. And when liberals respond by framing equal rights as a matter of “compassion” or “tolerance,” without mentioning the growing class divide, it’s not entirely surprising that sections of the white working class mishear calls for diversity as endorsement of their accelerating marginalization.As one young man complained while we were both waiting for relatives receiving treatment in a New Orleans hospital, “everybody talks about the problems of the blacks, the illegals, the gays, the transgenders. But I see a lot more of them getting ahead than white guys like me.” And an older woman told me “I actually voted for hope and change, but we haven’t gotten it down here, so when Clinton says, ‘oh we already ARE great,’ she loses me.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinions new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and FacebookNone of this excuses racist reactions. The tragedy is that in the “good old days” for white Americans without a college degree, their prosperity was less dependent on their unfair advantages over minorities than on a social consensus reaching across both parties that government could and should invest in infrastructure projects that create jobs for working people and enforce policies that protect workers’ bargaining power. In the 1960s, when civil-rights activism extended those opportunities and protections to minorities as well as whites, this resulted in increased progress for workers in general and for racial equality.The political challenge today is how to acknowledge the legitimate sense of loss and exclusion experienced by white workers while persuading them that reestablishing racial and masculine privileges is a poor substitute for ensuring secure rights for all workers and getting rid of a political decision-making process that is rigged against them by business lobbyists and financial interest groups.So far, most of Trump’s establishment critics have failed to persuasively explain how they would create well-paying jobs and improve working people’s bargaining power. So we see growing numbers of people who think that in a stacked deck, a “wild card” might not be such a bad thing. As a retired deputy sheriff from Montana put it, Trump is “risky” but at least he’s looking at things “through a different scope.”So far, most of Trump’s establishment critics have failed to persuasively explain how they would create well-paying jobs and improve working people’s bargaining power.

A United Cigars shop on one side of the street, a Western Union sign on the other. Lines of cars stretch into the distance. Even Shepard himself -- who is as much a fixture of Welch as any of its buildings -- is in the mural, a blue cap perched on his head.\"There wasnt ten square feet in this town that didnt have a successful business in it, a business of every kind,\" Shepard said in an interview. \"No matter what you wanted or needed, you could buy it in Welch.\"Those were better days.Now its a place, people who live here say, that politicians use as a convenient photo op and that the federal government has left behind, a sentiment common among white working class voters. 56% of non-college educated whites say the government in Washington does not represent them, according to a new poll conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation. And two-thirds say they are dissatisfied with the influence people like them have on politics.Locals referred to the once-bustling Welch as \"Little New York,\" but now the town and the county around it are slowly slipping away. The storefronts are empty. The buildings and houses here are now crumbling with decay. Shepard used to take checks to the bank each Monday -- sometimes $1,000, sometimes $1,500. He hasnt had to do that in four or five years he said, because he hasnt had one customer in that long.\"Its depressing to watch the population disappear, the businesses disappear and the activity stop. Back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, it was hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and theres nobody.\" -- Ed Shepard, 93.\"Its depressing to watch the population disappear, the business disappear and the activity to stop,\" he said. \"Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, itd be hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and theres nobody.\"McDowell Countys population is just 19,835 down from 100,000 in the 1950s. That decline is expected to continue. West Virginia University economists estimate that McDowell will continue to lose residents at a rate of 1% each year.Some, particularly in rural areas like McDowell County, say the governments at fault. Rural working class whites are more likely to blame the federal government for their economic problems than their urban counterparts. Seven in ten say the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for the economic problems facing the working class, in the CNN Kaiser survey, compared with half of urban working class whites. That could explain the appeal of a candidate who is not only intent on upsetting the political system, but has at times seemed bent on breaking it down to start over again.On this winding drive through the hilly roads of Appalachia, there are few signs signaling support for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but Trump is expected to do well here. West Virginia hasnt voted for a Democrat since Bill Clintons second term. Much has changed in the last 20 years and now Clinton is seen as squarely at odds with the coal industry, which is the bedrock of Welch and the surrounding county.No matter who wins in November, some residents of West Virginia coal country dont believe anything will change their lives. They have come to accept, as Gary Hall, a 55-year-old Trump supporter put it, \"that next year is going to be worse than the last year\" no matter who is president.\"When we have a natural disaster in the country, everybody shows up. Were the same as a natural disaster without the effects, without the storm, or without the flood. ... Hopefully we can get it turned around and hopefully well get some attention from Washington.\" -- Cecil Patterson, 51 (left in photo)Hall said he felt alienated from the political process, but rejected the idea that he and other whites without college degrees were angry and flocking to Trump as a result. The CNN/Kaiser foundation survey suggests thats the case, too. Just 19% of working class white voters described themselves as angry about how things are going in their own lives.\"Were conditioned that theres really nothing you can do about it. The only thing outrage and protesting and stuff does is cause bad feelings,\" he said. \"People are just resigned to have what they have. The ones that want to leave, the ones that can leave and want to leave leave. Everybody else just stays here.\"Rural working class white voters like Hall are more likely to say Americas best days are behind us and that their children will be worse off than they are today. In the CNN/Kaiser survey, 58% of rural working class whites say Americas best days have come and gone and 57% say their children will be worse off compared with less than half of urban working class whites who say the same.West Virginia is one of the nations largest coal-producing states and McDowell County used to produce more coal than any county here. But theres been a steep downturn in coal jobs across the state due to competition with cheaper natural gas, tougher environmental rules and mechanization, and this county has seen the worst of it.\"We dont have another option,\" said Cecil Patterson, 51, who spent his life working in the coal industry and serves on McDowell Countys county commission. \"Once we shut down the coal industry here theres nowhere to go, theres nothing else to do, theres no other jobs available.\"The unemployment rate here was 12.5% in July, compared with 4.9% nationwide.When work dries up, people leave, Patterson said, doing anything they can to make ends meet.\"She [Hillary Clinton] wants to shut down the coal industry -- thats gonna put me out of a job. Wouldnt be real smart to vote for somebody whos gonna put you out of a job.\" -- Ryan Barnette, 34\"You cant just go to the next county here, you have to leave the state. A man tries to go out of the state, maintain an apartment, try to keep his home back up here, it just puts such a struggle on the family.\"Trump won McDowell handily in West Virginias May primary, taking 91.5% of the Republican vote -- his largest margin of victory in the country. But even before becoming his partys presumptive nominee the week prior, he was the favorite to win in the state.During a campaign rally in West Virginia in May, Trump promised to bring back lost-coal mining jobs but hasnt said how hed pull it off. Many people here were skeptical that he could -- but credit him with giving them hope.And animosity toward Clinton runs high. Even months later, people still repeat -- verbatim -- the comment Clinton made that her climate change policies would \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"Many people here with ties to the coal industry -- virtually everyone here is linked to it -- see Clintons comments about coal disqualifying and Trump as their only answer.\"It aint gonna be Hillary,\" said 34-year-old Ryan Barnette, his face black with soot, minutes after leaving the mine. \"She wants to shut down the coal industry -- thats gonna put me out of a job.\"\"Our main industry has been coal. When you dont diversify and have other means, then the coal miners are laid off, either they stay and have no money to spend, which trickles down everywhere... Or they eventually have to pack up and move so that they can find work.\" -- Elaine LaCaria, 54Elaine Lacaria -- known here as Laney -- was a lifelong Democrat and voted for Clinton eight years ago. But now things have changed.\"I wont vote for her again. No, never,\" she said in an interview in the dress shop she opened in 2008, the same year then-Senator Barack Obama was elected president.In the eight years since then, she said things have gotten worse. Jobs have dried up, people are leaving and not coming back and addiction has ravaged this community and others near it.\"When we drive anywhere you see small town USA is no more,\" Lacaria said. \"This has affected all of us, not just the coal fields.\"Lacaria said shell never vote for a Democrat again and this year, shell support Trump.\"When I see Trump as a businessman, I think he will help our county definitely, but I think he will help our country as a whole. He knows what hes doing.\"Patterson, who also said he plans to vote for Trump due to his support of the coal industry, said the same.\"When we wake up the morning after an election, our roads are going to be getting worse, our sewer, our water, our schools are failing, Patterson said. \"They want us to keep paying more and we keep getting less, so theres my take on where were at the day after the election.\"\"We look different, we talk different, and people seem to think we dont exist. But if youre hungry, well split our last meal with you. If youre cold, well get you some kind of--to stay warm. We give everything that we got. And we get nothing back.\" -- Vira Rose, 69Others, like 69-year-old Vira Rose, say no politician or government got them in this position. And they dont expect to be saved.Rose, who was one of the first women to work as a mine foreman in the area, owns her own auto repair shop. She once sold new tires, now a stack of used tires for sale sits outside of the shop. People cant afford new ones anymore, she said.\"Sometimes I come here at 8 a.m., I get out of here at 8 or 9 at night. Any job comes, you dont turn it down and say tomorrow. If you say tomorrow, tomorrow wont be here. You grab it, you do it -- then you help others,\" she said. \"Were the forgotten tribe.\"She has no faith in Clinton or Trump.\"What am I gonna do? Im not gonna vote for neither damn one of them,\" Rose said. \"Because theres not much difference, theres really not.\"", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/election-2016-white-working-class-donald-trump-kaiser-family-foundation/index.html"}, {"title": "White working-class Americans have split on Muslim immigrants", "data_published": "set()", "content": "Story highlights White working-class Americans form the backbone of Donald Trumps political support New data suggests they have complicated viewson immigrants from Muslim countriesEditor’s Note: White, Working-Class and Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class Americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week.Washington CNN —The white, working-class Americans who form a backbone of Donald Trump’s political support have a split view of Muslim immigrants – strong majorities believe both that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the threat of terrorism in the United States, but also that most immigrants from those countries are good people.The data is from a new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation and is aimed at unveiling the political motivations of the voting bloc that has propelled the GOP nominee.Threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism.Trump’s tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the US-Mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise.While a majority (63%) of white, working-class Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks.Members of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the US electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country.Even among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from Muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not.There is also a partisan divide: White, working-class Democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from Muslim countries than their white, working-class Republican counterparts. 47% of white Democrats without college degrees say Muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US compared with 83% of white Republicans with no college degree.Trump has made his hard line against Muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from Muslim countries. Fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting Trump say immigrants from Muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US.’Under attack’More than 6-in-10 white, working-class Americans also say that Christian values are under attack in the United States. That viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. Seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said Christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same.Trump backers were more likely to say that Christian values were under attack than those who support Clinton. Eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in November said Christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support Clinton.Candidate positioningIn the hours following the bombings in New York and New Jersey, Clinton and Trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause.Clinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent’s positions are “not grounded in fact” and “meant to make some kind of demagogic point.”“I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges,” the former secretary of state told reporters on Monday, “not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric.”Trump blamed Clinton and President Barack Obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. Instead of treading lightly, Trump said on Fox News Monday morning, the better approach would be to “knock the hell out of ‘em.”“Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are,” Trump told Fox. “They are afraid to do anything about it, because they don’t want to be accused of profiling. And they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things.”The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites – white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the Hispanic working class.Full methodological details are available here.", "link": "https://cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/white-working-class-americans-have-split-on-muslim-immigrants-trump-clinton/index.html"}]
